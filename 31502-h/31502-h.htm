<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIRST AMERICANS</h2>

<p>We are proud of being Americans. But
we must not forget that the Indians once
owned all America, north and south and east
and west.</p>

<p>The Indians were the first Americans of
whom we read. No people ever had a greater
love for their land, and no race has ever taken
more pleasure in out-of-door life.</p>

<p>After Columbus found the New World,
white men came from Europe to make their
homes here. As time went on they drove the
Indians farther and farther west and took
away their hunting grounds.</p>

<p>Let us try to imagine our country as it was
when the Indians owned it. Can we picture
our land without a house or a store or a railroad?
Can we think of great rivers with no
cities on their banks and with no bridges on
which to cross from one side to the other?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Every boy we know likes to go camping.
But who would be willing to set up a camp far
away in the deep woods without taking with
him tent or food or blankets?</p>

<p>Before trade with the white men began,
the Indians found everything they needed in
the wild land about them. They could make
their own weapons and tools, their canoes and
paddles, their houses and clothing, and even
build a fire without matches.</p>

<p>Your fathers leave home to earn money for
your food and clothing. Your mothers see
that your meals are cooked and that your
clothes are bought or made.</p>

<p>The Indians took care of their children in
much the same way. During the hunting
season the fathers and big brothers went away
every morning to hunt. The men provided
all the meat for their families, and all the
skins for clothing and covers.</p>

<p>When a deer or a bear was shot, the hunter
brought it to the camp and threw it down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
His work for the day was done&mdash;the women
could do the rest.</p>

<p>And it was wonderful to see what the
wives and mothers could do with a big animal.
Was there a wigwam in the tribe without
food? The meat was shared to the last mouthful.
Was there an abundance? The meat was
dried for long keeping.</p>

<p>Did the son need more covers for his bed?
A bear's skin was finished like a fur rug for
his comfort. Did the black-eyed daughter beg
for a new dress? Her mother could make
from the deerskin a soft garment beautifully
trimmed with colored beads, stained quills,
and fringes.</p>

<p>But what did the Indians do when they
could find no more game to shoot with their
arrows? Why, they sent out scouts to select
a better place to live, and the chief gave orders
for every one to move.</p>

<p>Down came the lodge poles. The trained
dogs were called and loaded, and away they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
all went. Just think of a whole village moving
and leaving nothing behind but the land!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/0010-illus.png" width="500" height="368" alt="The village is moving" title="The village is moving"/>
</div>

<p>The Indians spent much time in feasting,
dancing, and games. During the summer the
men had little else to do, for they seldom
hunted while the wild animals were caring
for their young.</p>

<p>Each tribe was ruled by a chief and a council
of warriors. All their lands were held in
common, and no one suffered want except
when food was scarce for all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Every boy was watched with interest by
the whole village. His first walking was
noticed, and his first success
in hunting was often
celebrated by a feast.</p>

<img src="images/0011-illus.png" width="100" height="178" alt="The medicine man" title="The medicine man"/>
</div>

<p>When the corn was
ripe, the Indians held one
of the most important
dances of the year to show
their thanks to the Great
Spirit for the gift of corn.</p>

<p>In times of sickness,
the medicine man came
with rattle and drum to drive away the evil
spirits that were believed to have caused
the trouble. If the sick person grew worse,
Indians, with their faces painted black,
crowded the wigwam and more medicine men
were called.</p>

<p>They drummed harder and harder. They
yelled and beat their rattles, thinking that
they were helping the sick one to recover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>When anyone in the tribe died, the things
he had cared for most were placed in his grave.
There were toys for a little child, and weapons
and blankets for a warrior. The favorite
horse of a chief was often killed to be his companion
on the journey to the land of spirits.
Even food was carried to the burial place because
the trail was long that led to the Happy
Hunting Grounds.</p>

<p>After many years, the early customs
became greatly changed. To-day large numbers
of Indians are living in the white man's
way. Some are well educated and own houses,
farms, and even automobiles. Their children
are trained in government schools. There are
writers among them whose books we like to
read, and there are artists who paint interesting
pictures of Indian life.</p>

<p>During the great World War the Indians
begged to join the army, and hundreds enlisted.
Young men from many tribes were in
France, and there were no braver soldiers.</p>

<h2>THE WILD-RICE INDIANS</h2>

<p>Every boy and girl who studies geography
can find the Great Lakes. In the states south
and west there are hundreds of small lakes
and rivers where wild rice grows in the shallow
water.</p>

<p>During the early days of our country,
different tribes of Indians gathered the wild
rice for food, and many battles were fought
for the rice fields.</p>

<p>From the birch trees of the forest the men
obtained bark for their canoes. In these light
boats the women pushed their way through
the thickets of ripe grain. They beat the
stalks with short sticks, letting the rice fall
into the canoes.</p>

<p>The wild rice was eaten raw from the
growing plants. It was also parched while
green for daily use, and bushels of the ripe
grain were stored away for the long, cold
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0014-illus" id="i0014-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0014-illus.png" width="500" height="254" alt="Harvesting rice" title="Harvesting rice"/>
</div>

<p>At harvest time there was always good
hunting, for great flocks of ducks, geese, and
other birds flew to the rice stalks to eat the
seeds.</p>

<p>In the spring the women, boys, and old
men spent weeks at the sugar camp. They
caught the maple sap in small bark dishes
and boiled it into sugar. The boys kept the
fires going under the kettles and, for the
first few days, ate nearly all the sugar they
made.</p>

<p>Many kinds of berries grew in this northern
country. These the Indian women picked
and dried. Indeed, the underground storehouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of a wigwam housekeeper was full of
good things to eat.</p>

<p>Hiawatha is said to have lived on the shore
of one of the Great Lakes. Before the white
men sold fire water to the Indians, there were
many happy homes in the forest. The ways
of living were the same as we read about in
Longfellow's poem, and the children were
trained to be brave and honorable and to
respect their elders.</p>

<p>The boys were trained in woodcraft. They
learned the names and habits of wild animals.
They could find their way alone through
dense forests; and they could see farther and
hear better than any boys we know.</p>

<p>The girls were taught by their mothers
to be modest and industrious. They made
beautiful beadwork to trim dresses and moccasins.
They could set up a wigwam, prepare
food, and keep a clean and orderly home.</p>

<p>This little book tells how children lived
and played long ago in the wild-rice country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Their tribe was then at peace with the fierce
Indians farther west. A few men of the village
had traveled north with furs, but the
children had never seen a white man.</p>

<p>The old-time life of the Indians is ended.
But there are camps in the unsettled lands of
the wild-rice region where many strange customs
can still be seen; where the Indian drum
is heard, and the women gather wild rice as in
the olden time.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<h2>STORIES AND STORY-TELLERS</h2>

<p>The Indians of long ago had no books and
no schools; but each tribe had its story-tellers,
who went from one wigwam to another.
Everywhere they were welcomed by old and
young and begged to return.</p>

<p>The stories were told and retold by their
hearers until learned. Indian mothers quieted
their fretful little ones by stories and
songs just as other mothers have always
done.</p>

<p>The Indian stories are strange, and some
are very beautiful. There are wonderful tales
of the sun, moon, and stars; of animals and
birds and trees; of the thunder and the lightning
and the winds.</p>

<p>Through stories the children learned the
strange beliefs of their parents. They were
taught to call the sun their father and the
moon their mother, and all the animals and
birds their brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>The Indians believed that good and bad
spirits were all around them on the earth and
above them in the sky.</p>

<p>They thought that animals and birds could
talk, and that they listened to everything
which was said in the wigwams.</p>

<p>Tales of fearless hunters and brave warriors
made the boys wish to become as brave
as their fathers. Tales of the men that had
brought great good to their people led the
children to hope that they, too, might sometime
bring blessings to their tribe.</p>

<p>The children learned that their fathers
worshiped the Great Spirit, and that no
warrior ever went on the warpath without
offering many prayers.</p>

<p>They were taught that many of their
dances were thank offerings to the Great
Spirit, and that the war dance was for success
in battle.</p>

<p>In winter evenings the Indians gathered
around the wigwam fire. This was their only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
light. The fathers and grandfathers told
wonderful stories of war and hunting, and
related the old tales they had heard when
they were children.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/0019-illus.png" width="500" height="483" alt="An evening of stories" title="An evening of stories"/>
</div>

<p>Night after night the boys were drilled in
repeating the stories they had heard. The
whole family listened attentively, helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
all, and praising the one who did the best.</p>

<p>Special training was given to the boys of
the tribe who showed the most talent. They
were carefully prepared to take the places of
the older story-tellers, for the tribal tales
must never be lost nor forgotten.</p>

<p>The Indian belief that animals can talk is
shown in many of their best stories. Here is
one about the birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">

<h2>WELCOME TO A PAPOOSE</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0021-illus" id="i0021-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0021-illus.png" width="500" height="354" alt="The morning" title="The morning"/>
</div>

<p>Little Wren flies here and there about the
village of wigwams. She is the news gatherer
for the bird council.</p>

<p>She peers into the tent openings and
listens to the talk of the mothers. She flits
about the trees where children play.</p>

<p>When a little son is born, she carries the
news to the birds, and they are sad. "Alas,
alas!" they cry. "We hear the whistle of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
arrow. The boy will grow, and he will shoot
us with his bow and arrows."</p>

<p>But when the wren chatters about the
coming of a baby girl, the birds chirp merrily.
They sing of the grains she will scatter when
she grinds the corn into meal.</p>

<p>They sing of the wild rice she will let drop
when she comes with her loaded canoe from
the rice harvest. "Sing merrily, sing merrily,"
they say. "Another woman child has
come to feed us!"</p>

<p>The cricket hops in the wigwam. And
the cricket is glad when the baby is a girl.
"I shall hide among the floor mats and sing
where she plays," he chirps.</p>

<p>But the cricket is sad when the baby is a
boy. "He will shoot me, he will shoot me!"
chirps the cricket. For, as soon as the boy is
old enough, he will be given a tiny bow; and
he will fit the sharp arrow and shoot the
cricket and the grasshopper.</p>

<p>The woodpecker welcomes the girl baby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
He sings of the wood worms he will find when
the girl goes with her mother for wood. For
the women of the wigwam break the dry
branches for the fire, and the wood worms
fall from their hiding places.</p>

<p>But the raven rejoices at the sight of the
boy baby in his cradle. "My food, my food!"
he croaks. A hunter has come to the camp.
He will shoot the rabbit and the squirrel and
the deer; and food for the hungry ravens will
be left where his arrows fall.</p>

<p>The Indian father rejoices when he looks
at his son. "May he grow to be a brave hunter
and a fearless warrior." Such is the Indian's
wish.</p>

<h2>THE INDIAN BABY AND HER CRADLE</h2>

<p>Why is the happy song of the robin heard
beside the lodge? Why chirps the cricket so
merrily?</p>

<p>Can you not guess? There is a new daughter
in the wigwam. Another wood gatherer
and fire maker has come to the tribe.</p>

<p>"Bring the new cradle, Nokomis. Let me
have the beautiful cradle I have made for my
little daughter." And Good Bird, the mother,
points with pride to a strange-looking object
that is not at all like the cradle your baby
sleeps in.</p>

<p>A straight board leans against the inner
lining of the lodge. To one side of it is fastened
a white doeskin bag which is trimmed
with beautiful fringes and beadwork. Can
this be a baby's cradle?</p>

<p>Nokomis, the grandmother, opens the bag,
which is laced down the middle with colored
strings. She makes a bed of soft moss upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the hard board and lays the papoose very
straight in its little frame.</p>

<p>Laced and bound, this strange cradle is
hung to the top of the lodge. A bow of curved
wood protects the baby's head from injury,
should the cradle fall.</p>

<p>As the little papoose swings gently, the
Indian mother sings a lullaby, and this is the
one she often sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wa wa&mdash;wa wa&mdash;wa wa yea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swinging, swinging, lullaby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep thou, sleep thou, sleep thou.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little daughter, lullaby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wa wa&mdash;wa wa&mdash;wa wa."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Slower and slower swings the cradle and
the black eyes close in sleep.</p>

<p>"What shall we name the little one?" asks
the mother.</p>

<p>Nokomis stands in the door of the wigwam.
Through the trees she sees the blue water of
the lake. White clouds are moving rapidly
across the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"White Cloud shall be her name," answers
Nokomis.</p>

<p>Good Bird, the mother, smiles and nods.
As she watches the cradle, she talks to the
sleeping child.</p>

<p>"My little woman, you shall be a fire
maker and a lodge keeper like your mother.
You shall help me tan the skins for clothing.
I will teach you to make beautiful dresses and
trim them with beadwork and quills. Your
father and your brother will be proud to wear
the moccasins you make.</p>

<p>"You shall go with me to the lake when
the rice is ready to harvest. Together we will
hunt the wild berries and the nuts. You
shall be your mother's helper, my little
daughter, White Cloud."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<h2>WHITE CLOUD'S FIRST RIDE</h2>

<p>White Cloud, the baby daughter of Good
Bird, is having her first ride out of doors. Do
you think she is in a baby buggy like your
little sister's? Or do you suppose her mother
draws her in a tiny cart?</p>

<p>You can never guess unless you know
how Indian mothers contrive to take their
babies with them when they are carrying
heavy loads. White Cloud is laced in her
strange cradle and bound securely to her
mother's back.</p>

<p>On the bent strip of board that arches over
the head of the cradle are fastened playthings
made of carved wood and bone. The bright
toys jingle and rattle, and the baby laughs.</p>

<p>To-day the little arms and hands are firmly
laced inside the beaded bag. So the child can
not reach out and play with the noisy images
as she loves to do.</p>

<p>Laced, bound, and protected, the baby is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
safe even when her mother pushes through
the thickest forest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0029-illus" id="i0029-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0029-illus.png" width="500" height="278" alt="Children swimming" title="Children swimming"/>
</div>

<p>The boys, who run everywhere, have
brought good news to the camp. "The June
berries are ripe in the forest," they say. So
the mothers are starting with children and
bags for the berry picking.</p>

<p>It is not yet sunrise; but it is the custom of
the Indians to rise early. The men, with bows
and arrows, knives and spears, have already
gone away to their daily business&mdash;the hunt.</p>

<p>The older lads are with their fathers, and
the little boys have begun a long summer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
day of shouting, swimming, mud throwing,
and mischief. Among them is White Cloud's
brother, a sturdy boy of four years.</p>

<p>Here and there are old men sitting in front
of their lodges and smoking their long pipes.
Inside, the grandmothers are busy preparing
food and dressing skins for clothing.</p>

<p>Most of the women, like Good Bird, carry
their babies and berry sacks upon their backs;
but some of them have large dogs trained as
burden carriers.</p>

<p>Here comes Two Joys, the mother of twins.
She is followed by a pair of dogs, each dragging
a strapping brown baby boy.</p>

<p>One by one, the women and girls wade the
streams and climb the hills, following the trail
that leads to the forest. There they separate,
each to make her own choice of bushes.</p>

<p>White Cloud's mother chooses a thicket
where the berries are large and abundant.
She fastens her baby's cradle to the top of a
low tree. The wind swings the cradle, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
like the Mother Goose baby, the Indian
papoose rocks on the tree top. Let us hope
that the bough will not break.</p>

<p>The birds chirp and sing in the branches.
A squirrel comes near to see what strange
object is hanging in his tree. The baby wakes
and cries with fright, and the squirrel scampers
away.</p>

<p>Good Bird is filling her bags of woven grass
with purple berries. She does not pick them
as we do, but breaks off long branches loaded
with fruit. Then, with a heavy stick, she beats
the branch and the berries fall on a large skin
that is spread on the ground.</p>

<p>For dinner Good Bird has only dried meat
and the sweet, juicy berries. But she does
not think of wishing for more.</p>

<p>At last the ripe fruit is gathered. The
baby is fretting, and the mother takes the
cradle from the tree top. She unlaces the bag
and lays the little one on the warm grass.</p>

<p>Now the fruit must be packed and tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and the large skin be rolled up. While the
mother works the child grows restless and
cries. You can never guess why. She is asking
in baby language to be put back on her
stiff board!</p>

<p>Very soon Good Bird is ready and, with
the cradle and bags strapped to her back, she
starts for home. Other berry pickers loaded
with fruit join her, and together they walk
the trail that leads back to the camp.</p>

<p>Nokomis is watching for the baby. She
lifts the cradle and hangs it to the lodge pole.
The little one is restless. She turns her head
from side to side, her black eyes shining.</p>

<p>Then the grandmother sings the owl song
in which Indian babies delight:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah wa nain, ah wa nain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is this, who is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving light, light bringing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the roof of my lodge?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The singer changes her voice to imitate
a little screech owl and answers:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is I&mdash;the little owl&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Coming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down! down! down!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As she sings, she springs toward the baby
and down goes the little head. How the
papoose laughs and crows! Again Nokomis
sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who is this, eyelight bringing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the roof of my lodge?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is I, hither swinging&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dodge, baby, dodge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Over and over the lullaby is sung, now
softer and now slower. The eyelids droop,
and the little one is quiet.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<h2>NOKOMIS TELLS A STORY</h2>

<p>Good Bird had prepared the evening meal,
but no one came to eat it. Her husband,
Fleet Deer, was late in returning from the
hunt, and her little son was still shouting and
running with his boy playmates.</p>

<p>The tired baby slept, and the two women
sat outside the wigwam in the warm June
evening.</p>

<p>"Now that I have a little daughter, I must
learn all your stories, Nokomis," said Good
Bird. "Suppose you tell one while we wait."</p>

<p>"I heard a new one last moon," answered
Nokomis. "Our village story-teller has traveled
far from our camp. He visited another
tribe and heard all their stories. I will tell
you the tale he told about the first strawberries:</p>

<p>"In the very earliest times a young girl
became so angry one day that she ran away
from home. Her family followed her, calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and grieving; but she would not answer their
calls, nor even turn her head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0035-illus" id="i0035-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0035-illus.png" width="500" height="341" alt="Learning new stories" title="Learning new stories"/>
</div>

<p>"The great sun looked down with pity
from the sky and tried to settle the quarrel.
First he caused a patch of ripe blueberries
to grow in her path.</p>

<p>"The girl pushed her way through the low
bushes without stooping to pick a berry.</p>

<p>"Further on the sun made juicy blackberries
grow by the trail, but the runaway
paid no attention to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>"Then low trees laden with the purple
June berry tempted her, but still she hurried
on.</p>

<p>"Every kind of berry that the sun had ever
helped to grow, he placed in her path to cause
delay, but without success.</p>

<p>"The girl still pressed on until she saw
clusters of large ripe strawberries growing in
the grass at her feet.</p>

<p>"She stooped to pick and to eat. Then she
turned and saw that she was followed.</p>

<p>"Forgetting her anger, she gathered the
clusters of ripe, red berries and started back
along the path to share them with her family.</p>

<p>"Then she went home as if nothing had
ever happened!"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIREFLY DANCE</h2>

<p>It is a summer evening. There is no moon,
and the stars twinkle brightly in the sky. A
half circle of Indian lodges fronts a small
lake. Wide meadows slope to its shores.</p>

<p>All the air is alive with lights, twinkling,
whirling, sparkling. Thousands of fireflies
are swarming above the grass.</p>

<p>The meadow is full of Indian boys and
girls, little and big, dancing the firefly dance.
Advancing and retreating, turning and twisting,
bowing and whirling, they imitate the
moving lights about them and above them.</p>

<p>In front of the lodges sit the warriors and
the squaws looking on.</p>

<p>Good Bird is watching every move of her
son. He is one of the most active dancers on
the field.</p>

<p>"Look, Nokomis!" she says, "No boy is
straighter than your grandson, and there is
no better dancer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0038-illus" id="i0038-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0038-illus.png" width="500" height="332" alt="A dance" title="A dance"/>
</div>

<p>Fleet Deer says nothing, but he is thinking
of the time when his son will take part in the
war dance of his tribe.</p>

<p>Little White Cloud stands by her mother.
She has known three winters and is now a
chubby, pretty little Indian girl.</p>

<p>Suddenly she begins to imitate her brother.
She throws out her tiny brown arms, turns
round and round, jumps and bows, while
Nokomis and Good Bird shout with laughter.</p>

<p>Listen! the children are singing. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
do they say? It is the song of the fireflies that
we hear.</p>

<p>Nokomis has chanted the same words and
melody for many a lullaby, and she keeps
time, singing the same song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wau wau tay see, wau wau tay see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flitting white fire insect,<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>
<h2>SWIFT ELK, THE INDIAN BOY</h2>

<p>Four years have passed since the summer
evening when Good Bird watched her children
in the firefly dance. Her son, Swift Elk,
is now a tall, straight lad of eleven winters.
His sister, four years younger, is a sturdy
little girl, already able to help her mother in
many ways.</p>

<p>The boy is the pride of the lodge. From
his earliest babyhood he has been trained to
be strong and fearless.</p>

<p>"Lay him very straight," his father used
to say when the baby boy was placed on his
cradle board. "Do not make his bed too soft.
My son must grow tall and strong, for he will
sometime be a great warrior."</p>

<p>Since he could first walk he has gone with
his father each day to the lake to take an early
morning bath. Like all Indians, he learned
to swim when he was very small, and he loves
to splash and dive and play in the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Do you suppose that Swift Elk dresses
himself after his bath? He does not think
clothing at all necessary except in winter.</p>

<p>Does he help his mother in her work about
the lodge? Never! "A boy does not do
squaw's work," he says. "A boy must learn
to hunt and shoot."</p>

<p>Is he not made to mind? Is he never punished?
Oh, no; he will be a great warrior some
day, and his father says he ought not to be
afraid of any one. And so he lives the wild,
free life of the Indian boy. He spends his day
in play, with no school, no lessons, and no
work to do.</p>

<p>When the father is at home he teaches the
boy to notice very carefully everything he
sees. He must learn the names of plants and
birds. He must know the habits of animals
and how to hunt them. Above everything, he
must be brave and daring.</p>

<p>While the men are away hunting, the
younger boys spend the day shooting, fishing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
swimming, and playing games. If they wish
to throw mud balls at each other, no one scolds
them for being dirty. But if one of them
whimpers or cries, his companions will not
let him play. So the Indian boy learns early
in life to bear pain without complaint.</p>

<p>Swift Elk's father made a little bow and
arrow for his son as soon as he was old enough
to run out of the wigwam. Each summer he
received a larger bow and more destructive
arrows.</p>

<p>Wherever the boy goes he carries his
weapon, and he is always watching for the
chance to shoot a bird, rabbit, squirrel, or any
wild animal.</p>

<p>How his mother and grandmother praise
him when he brings home game! "You will
be a great hunter," they say. "Soon you will
be able to go with your father to shoot bear
and deer."</p>

<p>Swift Elk sleeps on a bed of cedar boughs
covered with skins. As the first-born son, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
has the place of honor. His bed is next to his
father's, close against the inner lining of the
lodge, and nearly opposite the entrance.</p>

<p>This is the boy's own place, and he is
allowed to decorate it as he wishes. Birds'
wings, feathers, and squirrels' tails show his
skill in hunting.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<a name="i0043-illus" id="i0043-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0043-illus.png" width="100" height="212" alt="A boy's desire to be older" title="A boy's desire to be older"/>
</div>

<p>Here he keeps nearly
everything that he owns.
He has hung his bow and arrows
on the lodge pole above
his bed. His snowshoes, tops,
and balls are in a bag of skin
high above the reach of baby
hands.</p>

<p>Swift Elk looks forward
to the time when he shall be
admitted to the councils of his tribe and take
part in their dances and yearly feasts.</p>

<p>Like other Indian children, he has been
trained to count time by winters, moons, and
sleeps, and so he does not know his exact age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
He has never heard of keeping birthdays; but
he has had many feasts given in his honor,
which are the same to him as a party would be
to you.</p>

<p>When an Indian boy wins a game which
requires great skill, or shows himself brave
in time of danger, his companions shout his
praises.</p>

<p>They go with him to the door of his lodge,
telling of the brave deed he has performed.
Then they sing and dance in his honor.</p>

<p>It is expected that the women of the lodge
will show their pleasure by giving each boy
some dainty from the stores of food packed
away for feasts.</p>

<p>On the day that Swift Elk first shot a rabbit
his father gave a feast for him, inviting all
his relatives. But the most important celebration
of his whole life was when he won a
victory in racing and received his name.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE NAMING OF SWIFT ELK</h2>

<p>Unlike their sisters, Indian boys are seldom
named in babyhood. Some are known
only as the sons of their fathers. Others bear
the nicknames given by their companions.
But often a boy's name is decided upon by
reason of some important action of his own.</p>

<p>For the first few years of Swift Elk's life
he was spoken of as the son of Fleet Deer.
When he was quite small, he stood, one evening,
watching the older boys race. They ran
in couples, their companions standing on
either side of the race course. There were
yells of joy for the victors, and jeers and howls
for those who were so unlucky as to trip or
stumble in the way.</p>

<p>A young hunter standing near noticed the
shining eyes of the little watcher and shouted,
"Give the younger boys a chance!" And so
the son of Fleet Deer was started in the race
with a boy of his own size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Once, twice, thrice, did the eager child
outrun his playmate amid shouts and
laughter. His little feet seemed to fly over
the ground.</p>

<p>"He is as swift as a young elk," said the
bystanders. And before the racing was
ended, the child was called again to the trial
of speed, this time with an older lad. Again
he was first at the goal.</p>

<p>"He will be a runner like his father," said
the warriors who had come near to watch the
sports of their children.</p>

<p>Fleet Deer, when a young man, was the
fastest runner in his tribe. And now his
little son had won a race and the father was
proud. He walked slowly toward his lodge
and entered the curtained opening.</p>

<p>"Prepare a feast in honor of our son,"
he said to Good Bird, his wife.</p>

<p>Standing in front of his wigwam, he
called in a loud voice the names of his brothers
and kinsmen in the camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0047-illus" id="i0047-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0047-illus.png" width="500" height="255" alt="A celebration" title="A celebration"/>
</div>

<p>They came, one by one, entered the low
doorway, and were seated in a circle close to
the inner wall of the wigwam, some on the low
beds and some on mats.</p>

<p>Nokomis and Good Bird passed to each a
wooden dish containing meat, dried berries,
parched rice, and maple sugar.</p>

<p>There were many prayers and much smoking
of the long pipe which was passed from
host to guest. Then Fleet Deer led his son to
the middle of the wigwam. The child's face
and body were painted, and his long hair was
braided and wound around his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>"You have seen my son outrun his playmates,"
said the father. "You know that he
has taken the honors of victory from a companion
that is older and larger. One and
another who watched the race have said that
my son is like a young elk in his running.</p>

<p>"I was but a lad, my kinsmen, when your
former chief, my father, gave me the name I
bear. He has taken the long journey to the
land of spirits. Will you agree that his grandson
bear the name of Swift Elk?"</p>

<p>The warriors gravely bowed their heads
in approval. Again the pipe was passed, and
the smoke curled and rose in the lodge.</p>

<p>Swift Elk, the grandson of a great chief,
had earned his name.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>
<h2>FIRE AND THE FIRE MAKERS</h2>

<p>"Are you going away, Grandmother?
Take me with you."</p>

<p>"I am on my way to the forest, White
Cloud. It will be a long walk for you. We
need dry moss and decayed wood for tinder.
Some cold morning we shall wake and find no
red coals in the ashes. Then we shall need
some pieces of the driest of wood to kindle a
new fire."</p>

<p>"Let me go, and I will help you look for
dry wood. I know I am big enough to be a fire
maker. Haven't I seen seven winters?"</p>

<p>So Nokomis and White Cloud started on
the trail that led to the wild forest. There
great trees had died and fallen, and the
branches had been decaying for many moons&mdash;no
one can tell how many.</p>

<p>"Is the fire always lost when we move our
camp, Grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Not always. Some lodge keepers try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
carry a few coals, and the one who succeeds
is glad to share with others. But one person
is often sent ahead to the new camp to make
a central fire out of doors. You know it takes
a long time to get a spark by rubbing two
sticks together."</p>

<p>"How did the Indians get fire in the first
place? And how did fire get into wood?"
asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"I will tell you, my child. I have heard
all about it from the story-tellers.</p>

<p>"Once there was only one fire in all the
world. It was kept in a sacred wigwam and
guarded by an old blind man.</p>

<p>"All the Indians had heard about fire and
wanted very much to get it. But no one knew
where it was hidden.</p>

<p>"The old man had two daughters who gathered
his wood. He used only the driest
branches, so that no smoke could be seen, and
no odor from the burning of green boughs be
lifted to the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>"But one day a tiny, curling wreath of
smoke rose above the lodge opening.</p>

<p>"Of course the birds saw it, and flew over
the lodge poles until they discovered the
secret. You may be sure that they chirped
the news wherever they flew.</p>

<p>"A woodpecker went into a hole in a tree
to carry his mate some food and told her where
fire was kept. He was overheard by a squirrel
running up the tree trunk.</p>

<p>"'Chip, chip! chatter, chatter! Hear the
squirrels in the tree tops,' said a rabbit. 'What
are they talking about?' By listening he soon
found out.</p>

<p>"Then Bruin heard the rabbits, and the
bear teased the wolf by letting him know that
the birds had a great secret.</p>

<p>"A flock of sparrows settled in front of the
wolf's den, and the wolf soon heard all he
wanted to know. He, in turn, told a dog that
sometimes ran with him at night.</p>

<p>"Of course the dog told the boy he loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
best, and so the Indians found out where fire
was hidden.</p>

<p>"'We must have fire,' they said. 'Who will
get it for us?'</p>

<p>"At last Manabush said that he would try
to get fire for his tribe.</p>

<p>"Manabush was a daring young Indian
hunter. Like Hiawatha, he spent his life trying
to help his people. He saw how fire was
needed to warm the lodges in winter, and to
cook the raw meat freshly killed in the hunt.</p>

<p>"So Manabush made a birch canoe and
started across the great lake. When he
reached land he pulled his light canoe out
of the water and carried it on his back to a
near-by thicket. Then he changed himself
into a rabbit and hopped away into the long
grass.</p>

<p>"Soon there came up a great storm. The
old man guarded the sacred fire with the utmost
care until the rain was over. Then he
went to sleep near the glowing coals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>"His daughters came out of the lodge to
look at the sky. As they bent down to enter
the low door, they saw a little rabbit lying on
the grass. His fur was wet, and he was trembling
with cold.</p>

<p>"One of the daughters carried him in and
laid him down where it was warm. The rabbit
hopped nearer the fire.</p>

<p>"The old man started from his sleep.
'What do I hear?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'You have heard nothing, Father. We
picked up a little wet rabbit and brought him
in to dry.'</p>

<p>"The old man closed his eyes again. His
daughters turned and went on with their
work. Quickly the rabbit seized a burning
stick and hopped away by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>"Up jumped the old man. 'My fire, my
sacred fire, is stolen!' he cried. His daughters
ran out of the lodge to chase the thief.</p>

<p>"But the old blind man thought that someone
was in the wigwam. So he snatched a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
stick and pounded so hard on every side that
he beat some of the fire into a log. This is the
way that fire came to be in wood."</p>

</div>

<p>"What did the rabbit do, Grandmother?"</p>

<p>"He ran to the canoe, changed back to a
man, put the fire in a magic bag, and paddled
as fast as he could to his own camp.</p>

<p>"There he lighted a pile of wood for his
grandmother, and then hurried away to the
Thunderers. They have kept the sacred fire
for the Indians since that day."</p>

<p>"Who are the Thunderers, Grandmother?"
asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"After we have had our dinner I will tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
you the story. Now we will use some of our
dry wood and make a fire."</p>

<p>"Can I learn to get the fire out of wood?"
asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"You will need to try again and again, for
it is not an easy task. Watch me, my child,
and see how it is done."</p>

<p>Nokomis soon had a pile of dry grass and
twigs. Then she rubbed two pieces of wood
together for a long time. At last a spark flew
from the dry wood and the grass was lighted.</p>

<p>Meat and birds' eggs were soon roasted in
the hot ashes. After the meal Nokomis and
White Cloud started for home, each with a
bundle of wood strapped to her back.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready for the story you promised
me," said White Cloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE THUNDERERS</h2>

<p>"Far in the east, above the sky, the great
Thunderer lives with his two sons. They are
the friends of the whole world. When you
hear their voices be glad, for they are bringing
the gift of rain.</p>

<p>"In the spring they come from their sky
home with the showers that make the grass
grow and the little plants peep out of the
ground.</p>

<p>"They water the earth; and the corn comes
up, the sap flows for our sugar, the trees open
their leaves and blossoms, and the berries
ripen.</p>

<p>"Without their help every growing plant
would turn brown and fade away. The wild
rice and the sugar trees would die. Animals
would search in vain for food, and they would
crawl into their dens and perish.</p>

<p>"There would be no game for the hunter
to shoot. Then the terrible famine spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
would enter our lodges, and we would sicken
and die.</p>

<p>"We should never fear the loud voices of
the Thunderers, for they are always good and
kind.</p>

<p>"They are the war chiefs of the world.
When we see the rainbow, we catch a glimpse
of the splendid robes they wear.</p>

<p>"In the middle of their great lodge burns
the sacred fire, which they guard for all the
people of the earth."</p>

<p>"I will never be afraid again when I hear
them speaking," said White Cloud. "But I
like to be in the lodge when they bring their
rain storms. If they come to-day perhaps we
can find a cave in the hills our trail crosses."</p>

<p>"It would not be safe for us to enter a cave
in the forest," replied Nokomis. "The Little
People might be in it, and they would be
displeased."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE FOREST</h2>

<p>"And now," said White Cloud, "I want to
hear all about the Little People."</p>

<p>"Speak low, White Cloud. We are coming
to the rocky hillside. We must listen, for we
may hear them drumming."</p>

<p>"I wish we could! We would run and try
to see them."</p>

<p>"It would be far better for us to turn and
run the other way. The Little People do not
like to be disturbed. If they should see us,
they might cast a spell on us."</p>

<p>"What harm would that do us?" asked the
child.</p>

<p>"We would forget where we are going and
who we are. We might wander in the woods
until we starved, for we could never find the
trail home."</p>

<p>"How do the Little People look, and what
do they do? Does anyone know?"</p>

<p>"They are handsome little men, smaller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
than the tiniest babies. By daylight they
drum and dance, for they are very fond of
music.</p>

<img src="images/0059-illus.png" width="500" height="266" alt="Dancing of the little people" title="Dancing of the little people"/>
</div>

<p>"If they are not disturbed, they are very
kind and helpful, especially to those who are
in trouble. They do not like to be seen, and
will never work if a man or woman, or even
a child, is in sight.</p>

<p>"Sometimes they come to the cornfield
when it is very dark. If they are heard, no
Indian goes out of the lodge. Often the field
will be found well weeded in the morning and
the earth loose about the growing plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>"Once, in the moon of ripe corn, there was
a woman alone with a sick child. She heard
the Little People near her lodge, and she remembered
to be very quiet. In the morning
her corn was all picked for her.</p>

<p>"If a hunter finds an arrow near the cornfield,
he must say very loud: 'Little People,
will you let me have this arrow?' for it may
have been shot from their bows.</p>

<p>"If he takes it without asking, he may be
hit with stones as he is walking home."</p>

<p>"Tell me about the boy who was changed
into a hunter spirit," said White Cloud.</p>

<p>"There was once a boy," began Nokomis,
"who ran away from home. He grew smaller
and smaller until he became like the spirits
of the woods.</p>

<p>"But he is full of mischief. You can sometimes
tell what he is doing, although he himself
is never seen.</p>

<p>"Have you not noticed your dog jump up
quickly from the place where he has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
sleeping? The spirit of the runaway boy is
whipping him with nettles.</p>

<p>"You will often see a flock of birds suddenly
leave their food and fly away. The little
hunter spirit has frightened them.</p>

<p>"When the tired hunter stops, far from his
lodge, to roast his meat, the little mischief-maker
blows out his fire and fans the smoke
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"He catches the arrows which are aimed
at the birds and hides them. He puts slippery
clay in the path and laughs when the children
fall. No one can tell all his tricks of mischief."</p>

<p>"Grandmother, look! Here is an arrow on
the ground."</p>

<p>"Let it be. We will not annoy the spirits.
Now we must hurry home, for the clouds
darken and I can hear the loud voices of the
Thunderers starting out from their sky home."</p>

<h2>BLACK WOLF TELLS A STORY</h2>

<p>The boys were practicing with their bows
and arrows. After a few trials, in which little
skill was shown, Swift Elk threw down his
bow. "I'm tired of shooting," he said. "Come
on, boys, let's go to the lake for a swim."</p>

<p>Black Wolf, the oldest warrior of the tribe,
was sitting on the ground near by, watching
the sport.</p>

<p>"Do not give up," said the old man. "You
are a big boy now. Only by skill in shooting
can you become a brave warrior. Let no
one know you are tired or weak. Remember
the boy who was changed to the lone lightning
of the North."</p>

<p>"Tell us the story," Swift Elk begged.
"Then we will practice again and do our
best."</p>

<p>The boys threw themselves on the ground
near Black Wolf, and he began the story.</p>

<p>"There was once a little boy who had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
one to care for him. His father had been killed
in war, and his mother taken captive by the
enemy.</p>

<p>"Minno, the lonely boy, lived in his uncle's
wigwam, but he was not wanted there. He
had hard work to do and very little to eat.</p>

<p>"He was too weak to join the rough games
of his playmates, and he did not become skillful
with his bow and arrows like the other boys
of the tribe.</p>

<p>"At last he became so thin from hunger
that the uncle feared his cruel treatment
would become known.</p>

<p>"So he told his wife to feed the boy with
bear's meat. 'Give him plenty of fat,' he
ordered. 'Cram him with bear's fat.' It was
now the uncle's plan to kill the boy by overfeeding.</p>

<p>"One day when Minno had been nearly
choked with fat meat, he ran away. He wandered
about in the woods, and when night
came he was afraid of the wild beasts. So he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
climbed into a tall tree and fell asleep in the
branches.</p>

<p>"In his dreams a person came to him from
the upper sky and said: 'My poor little lad, I
pity you. Follow me, and be sure to step in
my tracks.'</p>

<p>"So the lad arose and followed his guide
up, up, into the upper sky. There he was given
twelve magic arrows and told to shoot the
manitoes of the North.</p>

<p>"'They are the evil spirits of the air,' said
his guide. 'You must go to war against them.
I have given you magic arrows that will kill
them if your aim is true.'</p>

<p>"The boy placed an arrow with great care,
but failed to kill a manito. One, two, three,
four, five, six arrows had left his bow, each
leaving behind it a long streak of lightning.
But not one had reached its mark.</p>

<p>"Carefully he aimed; seven, eight, nine,
ten, eleven. Alas! his skill was not equal to
his task.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0065-illus" id="i0065-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0065-illus.png" width="500" height="255" alt="A dream" title="A dream"/>
</div>

<p>"Long he held the twelfth arrow. He
looked around on every side. The evil spirits
had wonderful power, and they could change
their forms in a moment.</p>

<p>"The boy let his last arrow fly toward the
heart of the chief of the manitoes. But the
evil spirit saw it coming and changed himself
into a rock.</p>

<p>"'How dare you try to kill me!' cried
the angry manito. 'Now you shall suffer.
You shall evermore be like the trail of your
arrow.'</p>

<p>"And he changed the boy into the lone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
lightning which you so often see, my children,
in the northern sky."</p>

<p>"I wish I could shoot as well as I can run,"
Swift Elk said. "It is easy to win in the races,
but I can never beat in a shooting match."</p>

<p>"You can if you will practice more than
the other boys. You remember how the crane
beat the humming bird in a race."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, tell us," begged all the
boys. "Then we will shoot our arrows all day
long until the sun hides his face."</p>

<p>The old man was silent for a time. Then
he said, "I will tell you just one more story.
And you shall keep your word and practice
until the darkness creeps over the earth."</p>

<h2>THE RACE BETWEEN THE CRANE AND THE<br />
HUMMING BIRD</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0067-illus" id="i0067-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0067-illus.png" width="500" height="255" alt="A humming bird" title="A humming bird"/>
</div>

<p>The crane dared the humming bird to a
race. The humming bird was as swift as an
arrow, but the crane flew slowly.</p>

<p>At the word they both started. The humming
bird was far ahead and he stopped to
roost on a limb; but the crane flew all night.</p>

<p>The humming bird woke in the morning,
thinking it would be no trouble to win the race.
He was very much surprised when he passed
the crane spearing fish for his breakfast!</p>

<p>"How did the Slow One get ahead?" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
thought. "I must start earlier in the morning."
He flew swiftly until dusk, when he
stopped to roost on a tree.</p>

<p>The crane flew all night. Before morning
he was again ahead, and he had finished his
breakfast when the Swift One passed him.</p>

<p>"This is indeed strange," thought the
humming bird. "But I can fly a little faster,
and it will be no trouble to win." So he
stopped again, far ahead, to take his usual
sleep.</p>

<p>The crane flew all night, as usual. He
passed the sleeping humming bird at midnight
and was well on his way before he was
overtaken. The humming bird flew as long
as he could see, and before midnight he was
again ahead.</p>

<p>Each night the humming bird slept. Each
night the crane flew. "Gaining a little; gaining
a little!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>Later and later in the day did the Swift
One pass the Slow One. Earlier and earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in the night did the Slow One pass the Swift
One.</p>

<p>On the last day of the race the crane was
a night's travel ahead. He took his time at
breakfast. The humming bird passed him
at sundown and stopped to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning the humming bird flew
like the wind and reached the goal early in
the day. But there stood the heavy crane
waiting, for he had flown all night!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>
<h2>HUNTING WILD DUCKS</h2>

<p>Swift Elk had sharpened his arrows and
taken his strongest bow from the wooden peg
over his bed.</p>

<p>"I have seen wild ducks flying by the lake,"
he said. "I am going to hide in the long grass
and watch for them. If they come again, they
shall feel my arrows. To-night we eat roast
duck."</p>

<p>The boy ran toward the lake. His sister,
White Cloud, watched him until he was out
of sight. "Why can't girls go hunting?" she
said. "I have seen seven winters. I shall
follow his trail."</p>

<p>The child ran along, hiding behind trees
and bushes, and stepping softly so that no
broken twig could tell of her approach.</p>

<p>Indian children can see farther and hear
far better than we can. Although the old-time
Indian never went to school, yet he trained
his children to listen to every sound in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
forest, and to notice all signs of animal life.</p>

<p>When White Cloud was near the lake, she
hid in a clump of bushes and watched. Just in
sight was a little stream winding through the
low meadow.</p>

<p>She saw Swift Elk run along its banks.
She waited without moving&mdash;waited as only
an Indian child knows how to wait.</p>

<p>At last, far off, she saw a speck in the sky,
then another and another. The specks grew
larger. She held her breath.</p>

<p>A flock of wild ducks flew across the lake.
Near the shore they turned and flew over the
low meadow where the boy hunter was hiding
in the high grass.</p>

<p>Suddenly the swift arrows flew. One, two,
three, four ducks were hit and fell to the
ground. Swift Elk picked up three and swung
them over his shoulder.</p>

<p>He looked a long time for the fourth duck.
Then, seeing another flock approaching, he
ran toward the lake shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Again he was fortunate in choosing the
place of their approach. White Cloud saw
more arrows fly, and more ducks fall. Swift
Elk ran on out of sight.</p>

<p>Then the little girl crawled from her
hiding-place and crept along the ground in
search of the missing duck. Surely there was
something stirring in the long grass ahead.
Almost afraid to move, the child crept closer
and closer, until she saw a duck with a broken
wing hanging useless by its side.</p>

<p>In a moment she had caught it. She held
the bird in her arms until its struggles ceased.
Then she bound its wing to its body with long
pieces of grass.</p>

<p>She crawled to the stream and dropped
water in its bill. The duck swallowed the
water but refused all food.</p>

<p>White Cloud watched every movement in
the distance, not daring to stand lest Swift
Elk return. So she worked her way, concealed
by high grass, to the home trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>How she ran until she reached the low wigwam
built for her dolls! Here she made a soft
bed for the wounded bird. She smoothed its
feathers and talked to it. How happy she was
when she was able to coax the duck to eat the
food she offered!</p>

<p>Swift Elk came home at night with all the
game he could carry. His mother praised his
hunting, and his father was pleased because
he had passed the entire day alone and without
a mouthful of food.</p>

<p>"You must endure hunger and thirst, cold
and heat, danger and pain, if you would become
a great warrior," said his father. "And
you must find your way alone through the
forest for miles and miles, listening every
moment for the footsteps of an enemy or the
approach of a wild beast."</p>

<p>A fire had been made in front of the lodge.
The ducks were buried, feathers and all, in
the hot ashes. White Cloud brought wild berries
and water from the spring. As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
the birds were roasted the feathers and skins
were pulled off and the hungry boy enjoyed
his meal.</p>

<p>But White Cloud watched her chance to
carry part of her own food to the duck. How
she hated to leave him when the dark came
on! But she fastened the shelter securely,
hoping that no lurking fox or weasel would
force his way inside.</p>

<p>The next morning White Cloud was up
before her brother. She hid in the tiny lodge,
to protect her pet until Swift Elk had left for
the day.</p>

<p>The duck soon became so tame that it followed
her wherever she went. The difficulty
in taming the wild creature, and the constant
danger of losing it, led the child to be as kind
and patient with her pet as an Indian mother
is with her papoose.</p>

<p>One day Good Bird was roasting deer
meat. She had made a hot fire in front of the
lodge. Sticks sharpened at both ends were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
driven in the ground close to the bed of coals.
The sticks were bent toward the fire, and each
one held a large piece of raw meat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0075-illus" id="i0075-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0075-illus.png" width="500" height="299" alt="A tamed duck" title="A tamed duck"/>
</div>

<p>When the meat was tender, Good Bird
called her little daughter. "My father is old,"
she said. "He can no longer hunt. Take some
of this roast meat to him."</p>

<p>White Cloud took the dish and went to her
grandfather's lodge, the duck waddling behind
her. After the old man had eaten, White
Cloud said, "Grandfather, do you know any
stories about ducks?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>"Point to the north, my grandchild, and
tell me who live in the land of ice and snow."</p>

<p>"North Wind and Old Winter," answered
the child.</p>

<p>"And what do they do, little one?"</p>

<p>"They send the game far from my father's
arrows. They freeze our food and try to starve
us. North Wind gives the war whoop as he
flies in the forest.</p>

<p>"Then Old Winter comes like the Indians
on the war trail. We cannot see him, and we
cannot hear him. He does not break a twig,
and his footsteps make no sound. He crowds
into our lodge, and tries to steal our fire and
freeze us. I wish he would never come again!"</p>

<p>"We must be brave, my grandchild. We
must make ready with food and firewood to
fight his power. I will tell you of a brave little
duck that even North Wind could not conquer."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>
<h2>A BRAVE DUCK</h2>

<p>Far to the north lived Wild Duck. His
lodge was by the frozen lake. Winter was
beginning, and he had but four logs of wood
for his fire.</p>

<p>"Four logs will do," he said. "Each log
will burn for many sleeps, and then spring
will be on the way."</p>

<p>Wild Duck was as brave as a warrior. On
the coldest days he went to the lake to fish.
He found the rushes that grew high above the
water. With his strong bill he pulled up the
frozen plant stems. Then he dived through
the holes he had made in the ice and caught
the fish swimming beneath.</p>

<p>In this way he found plenty of food. Every
day he went home to his lodge dragging
strings of fish. North Wind blew his fiercest
blasts, but no wind was cold enough to keep
Wild Duck in his wigwam.</p>

<p>"This is a strange duck!" said North Wind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
"He seems as happy as if it were the moon of
strawberries. He is hard to conquer, but I
will freeze him."</p>

<p>So the wind blew colder and colder, and
great drifts of snow were piled up about the
wigwam. But still the fire burned brightly.
The duck went daily to the lake, and daily he
brought home fish.</p>

<p>"Soon I will visit him," said North Wind.
"Then he shall feel my power."</p>

<p>That very night North Wind went to the
door of the wigwam. He lifted the curtain
and looked in.</p>

<p>Wild Duck had cooked his fish and was
lying before the bright fire. He was singing
a song to his enemy.</p>

<p>"You may blow as hard as you can, North
Wind," he sang. "I dare you to freeze me.
You may pile the snow to the top of my lodge.
I shall climb the drifts and go fishing just the
same."</p>

<p>"How dare a little duck sing like this about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
me?" blustered North Wind. "I will enter. I
will blow my cold breath upon him, and he
will freeze."</p>

<p>North Wind pushed his way through the
door and sat down on the opposite side of
the lodge. Cold blasts filled the hut.</p>

<p>Was Wild Duck afraid? He got up
and poked the fire, singing his song louder
and louder. Not once did he look at his
guest.</p>

<p>"Does he not know that I am here?"
thought North Wind.</p>

<p>The little duck stirred the great log until
it crackled and snapped.</p>

<p>"I cannot stand this heat," said North
Wind to himself. "I am melting. I must go
out." The water was dripping from his hair,
and tears ran down his cheeks. He crept out
of the wigwam and left Wild Duck to his
songs.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful duck!" he said. "I
cannot freeze him, I cannot even stop his singing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
The spirit of the fire is helping him, and
I will let him alone."</p>

<p>And to this day you can see the wild duck
fishing where the rushes grow. He is warm in
his coat of thick feathers, and North Wind
can never freeze the brave little duck.</p>

<h2>SUMMER SPORTS</h2>

<p>Swift Elk and his companions were cutting
great chunks of clay from the bank
near the stream. Soon a crowd of boys, each
armed with a large piece of clay and a long
green switch, ran shouting to the near-by
forest.</p>

<p>Here they divided into two bands for a
sham battle, and all hid behind trees. Balls
of clay were pressed on the ends of the slender
sticks and thrown, as you would throw green
apples.</p>

<p>Swift Elk ran out from behind the tree
where he had been hiding. Quickly he threw
mud balls at every boy that he saw peeping
at him.</p>

<p>Other boys rushed from their sheltering
tree trunks to dare the opposing forces.
A shower of mud balls filled the air. There
were shouts and war whoops, advances and
retreats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Dogs, barking and jumping, rushed into
battle with their masters.</p>

<p>When the clay was all used, the boys ran
to the bank for more. For half a day the fight
went on, many prisoners being taken on both
sides.</p>

<p>Here and there were young braves who
had been hit in the face and badly hurt. One
was suffering great pain with a swollen eye.</p>

<p>Do you think he left the game and ran
home? Do you think he cried or told tales?
A boy would rather stand pain than be
laughed at by his companions. "Tears are
for girls and women," they had all heard
their fathers say. "A warrior must not notice
pain."</p>

<p>At last, heated and mud-stained, they ran
to the lake and jumped in. You would have
thought they all needed a bath, could you have
seen them.</p>

<p>Splashing and swimming, diving and yelling,
they continued their battle by wrestling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
in the water. The day wore on. One by one,
tired with action, they left the lake. Some
lay on the grass, and others made images of
animals with soft clay.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/0083-illus.png" width="500" height="425" alt="Tired of playing" title="Tired of playing"/>
</div>

<p>Two or three boys, very hungry, shot some
birds, made a fire, and roasted their game. It
mattered not to them that their food was far
from clean.</p>

<p>Before they went home at night, Swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Elk's band dared the other side to a ball game,
to be played the next morning.</p>

<p>"Let us ask Black Wolf to watch our
game," said Swift Elk. All agreed. The old
warrior could not go on the long hunt or the
warpath, and nothing gave him greater pleasure
than to help the boys and young men in
their games of strength or skill.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BALL GAME</h2>

<p>Early in the morning the boys met on the
level piece of ground that had been selected
for the game. At each end of the field two
upright poles, a little distance apart, were
erected for goal sticks.</p>

<p>In the great ball games played by the men,
each side is allowed but one goal stick, which
must be hit by the ball. As this is very difficult,
Black Wolf helped the boys set up two
very long sticks, between which the winner's
ball was to be thrown.</p>

<p>Each player always carries a ball stick
bent at one end into a small hoop or ring.
Strips of rawhide are passed through holes
in the hoop, making a netted pocket in which
the ball may rest half hidden.</p>

<p>The one simple rule that each player
follows at all times is: "Keep the ball away
from your own goal." Only by sending
the ball off the field between the two goal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
sticks of the opposite side can victory be won.</p>

<p>Swift Elk and Antelope were chosen captains
because they were good runners. All
the best players stood in the middle of the field.
The younger boys were grouped about the goal
sticks with orders to send the ball back into
the field.</p>

<p>At a signal from Black Wolf, Antelope
tossed the ball into the air. It was caught by
a player on his own side, who started to run
in the opposite direction from his own goal
sticks.</p>

<p>The ball was knocked out of his hand and
thrown the other way. Back and forth it went
until Antelope caught it in his ball stick. He
started at full speed toward the goal on Swift
Elk's side.</p>

<p>In a moment he was caught and the ball
again turned. Running, screaming, throwing,
pushing, striking each other's arms with ball
sticks, the boys rushed together.</p>

<p>At last Antelope's side gained the advantage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Nearer and nearer the ball came to
Swift Elk's goal sticks. One strong throw,
and the game would be won. Antelope's players
danced and yelled with joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly a younger boy, one of the poor
players who was made to stand on guard,
caught the ball and sent it whizzing toward
Swift Elk.</p>

<p>The other side, sure of success, was taken
by surprise. Before Antelope could turn,
Swift Elk had the start and was speeding
toward the opposite goal.</p>

<p>"Never was there a finer race," Black Wolf
thought. All the boys had crowded together
at one end of the line to see the victory, leaving
an open field for the two fleetest runners.</p>

<p>You would have liked to see the two Indian
lads with painted bodies running like the
wind. They were followed by a crowd of boys
shouting, howling, rushing, pushing, and trying
in vain to overtake them.</p>

<p>But not even Antelope could regain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
advantage he lost in starting. Swift Elk
swung his stick and sent the ball spinning
between the two poles of the goal. He had
won the game for his side.</p>

<p>After the victors had shouted themselves
hoarse, they lay down on the ground near
Black Wolf and asked for a story.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said the old man, "of the
most wonderful ball game the world ever saw.
It happened long ago when the animals ruled
the land and there were no people on the
earth."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE ANIMALS AND THE BIRDS PLAY BALL</h2>

<p>Once the animals dared the birds to play
a game of ball with them. The birds chose the
eagle for their captain, and the animals chose
the bear.</p>

<p>They all talked at the same time, trying to
make their plans. When should they play?
Where should they play? "Leave that to the
eagle and the bear," said the deer. And all
agreed.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the animals met on
a smooth, grassy plain and the birds in a tree
top near by.</p>

<p>Captain Bear was so large and heavy that
he could pull down anyone who came in his
way. All along the trail to the ball ground he
tossed up great logs to show his strength; and
he bragged of what he would do to the birds
when the game began.</p>

<p>The turtle, at that time, was very much
larger than he is now. His shell was so hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
that the heaviest blows could not hurt him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0090-illus" id="i0090-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0090-illus.png" width="500" height="295" alt="A gathering of animals" title="A gathering of animals"/>
</div>

<p>He, too, was a great brag. Again and
again he rose on his hind feet and dropped
heavily to the ground. "Look at me," he said.
"See how I will crush any bird that tries to
take the ball from me." The swift deer, the
mountain goat, and the rabbit were at their
best speed. Indeed, the animals had a fine
team.</p>

<p>The eagle gathered his forces together.
There was the hawk, strong and swift, and the
wild geese that can fly without resting. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
black martin was there and the crow, with a
host of other birds. The blue jay was chosen
to scream in the ears of the animal players,
and the humming bird to fly in their eyes.</p>

<p>The birds looked at the great animals on
the field below, and were afraid. Just then
two little things hardly larger than field mice
climbed the tree where sat the bird captain.</p>

<p>They begged to join the game.</p>

<p>"You have four feet; why do you not go to
the animals, where you belong?" asked the
eagle.</p>

<p>"We did," said the little things, "but they
drove us off because we are so small."</p>

<p>"Let them play, let them play," called out
the birds in pity.</p>

<p>But how could they join the birds when
they had no wings? The eagle and the hawk
consulted, and it was decided to make wings
for the little fellows. What could they find
for wings?</p>

<p>At last someone remembered the drum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
they used in their dances. The head was made
of ground-hog skin. So they took the drumhead,
cut two wings, and made the bat.</p>

<p>Then they threw the ball to him. The bat
dodged and circled about, keeping the ball
always in the air; and the birds soon saw that
he would be one of their best men.</p>

<p>The other little animal came for wings, but
there was no more leather. What could be
done? Two birds thought they might enable
him to fly by stretching his skin. Thus was
the flying squirrel made.</p>

<p>To try him, the bird captain threw up the
ball. The flying squirrel sprang off the limb
after it, caught it in his teeth, and carried it
to another tree below.</p>

<p>All were now ready. The signal was given
and the game began. At the first toss the
flying squirrel caught the ball and carried it
up a tree. He threw it to the birds, who kept
it in the air for some time, until it dropped.</p>

<p>The bear rushed to get it, but the martin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
darted after it and threw it to the bat. By
dodging and doubling, the bat kept it out of
the way of the swift deer. And now the game
was close. The great deer could not turn as
quickly as the bat, and so he lost the game.
The little bat threw the ball between the posts
and won the victory for the birds.</p>

<p>And the bear and the turtle, who had done
the most bragging, did not have a chance even
to touch the ball.</p>

<p>For saving the ball when it dropped, the
martin was given a gourd to build his nest in.
And he still has it, for you can often see a
gourd on a post near the Indian lodges.</p>

<h2>GATHERING WILD RICE</h2>

<p>"Have you seen the beautiful new canoe
father has just finished?" asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"Seen it! I helped make it," answered
Swift Elk. "I cut nearly all the birch bark."</p>

<p>"Your father has it ready for the wild-rice
harvest," said Good Bird. "To-day I go
to tie the stalks. You are to help me, White
Cloud."</p>

<p>Nothing could have pleased the little girl
better. All summer she had hoped for this
great pleasure. From a low hill near her home
she had watched the growth of the rice.</p>

<p>When the June berries were ripe, the first
shoots came up near the shore of the lake. In
a few weeks the rice beds looked like beautiful
green islands in the water.</p>

<p>And when the yellow-green blossoms
opened, she coaxed her father to take her in
his canoe to the rice plants. She picked the
flowers, shaded with reddish purple, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
saw the spreading mass of blossoms, their
straw-colored anthers moving with every
breeze.</p>

<p>Swift Elk was very proud of the new canoe.
He had made the paddles, and had cut the
forked sticks that would be needed to force
the boat through the shallow water.</p>

<p>"When the rice is ripe, I'll go with you and
manage the boat," he said to his mother.
"When you come home to-night, White Cloud,
bring some green rice to parch for supper."</p>

<p>"I'll have some all ready for you," promised
his sister. "You shoot a deer to-day, and
to-night we'll have a feast. We'll ask grandfather,
and perhaps he'll tell us a story."</p>

<p>Soon Good Bird was paddling rapidly
toward the rice beds. It was a beautiful morning,
and White Cloud was as happy as any
little girl could ever be.</p>

<p>For many weeks she had helped her mother
prepare the string for tying the rice stalks.
It was cut from the inner bark of the basswood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
tree. The narrow bands were wound in a ball
so large that the child could hardly reach
around it.</p>

<p>"Why do you tie the wild rice stalks,
Mother?" she asked.</p>

<p>"So that our little brothers, the birds, can
not eat all our grain," answered Good Bird.
"All the bunches we have tied are our own,
and will be more easily harvested. No friendly
Indian ever touches the heads of rice bound
together by another."</p>

<p>With a curved stick Good Bird pulled a
mass of stalks within her reach and bound the
heads firmly together with the narrow strips
of bark. For hours she worked, forcing her
way through the thick mass of water plants
and tying the stalks on both sides of the canoe.</p>

<p>"May I come here again with you when the
wild rice is ripe?" asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"It will take two strong women to gather
the harvest, my child; but the canoe is very
long and I think you can help."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0097-illus" id="i0097-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0097-illus.png" width="500" height="339" alt="Harvesting rice" title="Harvesting rice"/>
</div>

<p>"How is it done, Mother?" asked the child.</p>

<p>"Swift Elk will sit at one end of the canoe
and paddle. Nokomis will bend the stalks
over the boat and untie the long pieces of bark,
and I shall beat the heads with a stick. The
grain will fall until the boat holds as much as
it is safe to carry."</p>

<p>"Are we going to take home any to-day?"
asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; when the rice is not quite ripe it
is just right for parching. As soon as my rows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
are all tied, you shall help me gather the
greenish kernels."</p>

<p>Good Bird worked until she had used all
her string. The long rows of heads, neatly
tied, looked very fine.</p>

<p>New plants were found, and the stalks
beaten with a stick. The rice fell into the
canoe, and White Cloud found it was good to
eat even without cooking. By sunset the bottom
of the canoe was covered with grain, and
they started home across the quiet lake.</p>

<p>"May we have maple sugar with our rice
to-night, Mother?"</p>

<p>"There is very little left, my daughter.
I think we would better save it for winter."</p>

<p>"When are we going to the sugar trees to
make more?"</p>

<p>"After the winter is nearly over and the
first crow comes to tell us that the sap is flowing.
Then we will move to our sugar lodge
and stay for a whole moon."</p>

<p>"May I take care of a kettle and boil sugar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
next time we go to the lodge?" asked White
Cloud, "By that time I can count eight
winters."</p>

<p>"You may if you will cut birch bark and
make your own sap dishes. You will need a
great many."</p>

<p>"Why can't we eat the sugar we have,
Mother? What is the use of saving it?"</p>

<p>"There may be little food on the cold,
snowy days that are coming. We shall need
the sugar more then than we do now. Have
you forgotten the story of the ant and the
katydid?"</p>

<p>"Tell it again. Tell it now before we get
home, Mother."</p>

<p>"I think there is time, as it is a short story,"
said Good Bird. And White Cloud listened
to the tale of the lazy katydid and the hard-working
ant while the canoe moved slowly
across the quiet lake.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE ANT AND THE KATYDID</h2>

<p>The oldest ant was building an underground
home. Through the long summer days
she worked, carrying out a grain of sand at a
time. Then she filled her storehouse with food
for the winter.</p>

<p>Her work was finished just as the frost
came to mow down the growing plants. All
summer the katydid called from the trees,
and the locust danced and buzzed in the sunshine.</p>

<p>When winter came, the oldest ant was
warm and comfortable and she had enough
food for her daily needs.</p>

<p>But the locust and the katydid were cold
and hungry. "Why should we freeze?"
chirped the katydid. "The ant has a warm
house." "And why should we be hungry?"
said the locust. "The ant has plenty of food."
So together they went to the home of the
oldest ant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>"Let us in, let us in, kind ant," they cried.
"We are cold and hungry."</p>

<p>"What did you do through the warm
weather?" asked the oldest ant.</p>

<p>"We played in the sunshine. We chirped
and buzzed and sang."</p>

<p>"Did you build no lodge? Could you not
store food for the time of frost and storm?"</p>

<p>"We had no need to work when the summer
was here with its warmth and beauty.
We danced away the happy hours."</p>

<p>"Go dance away the winter, then," said the
oldest ant. "I worked hard through all the
long summer days, and I had no time to dance
or sing."</p>

<p>The locust and the katydid turned away
shivering. "It is not fair," they said, "that the
ant has plenty and we have nothing. She
should be forced to let us in."</p>

<h2>HOW WILD RICE WAS DISCOVERED</h2>

<p>When Good Bird and White Cloud
reached home, they found great rejoicing.
Swift Elk had shot his first deer, and the
meat was already roasting by an outdoor fire.</p>

<p>The hunters had found game in abundance
that day, and many feasts were already
called in the village.</p>

<p>Swift Elk had chosen to invite only his
grandparents, and they were already listening
to his story of the hunt.</p>

<p>White Cloud made haste to parch the
rice, and soon a very hungry family was enjoying
the fresh and abundant food.</p>

<p>After the supper the children asked their
grandfather to tell them stories about wild
rice.</p>

<p>The old man remembered more than one
fierce battle for the possession of the rice
fields. Many years had passed since the peace
pipe was last smoked, and the children had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
lived without being in constant fear of war.</p>

<p>"My grandchildren," he said, "I will tell
you how rice came to be used in the earliest
times. There are many stories about Manabush,
and you have heard how he wrestled
with Mondamin and obtained the gift of
corn.</p>

<p>"In his early youth Manabush lived with
his grandmother, who taught him his duty to
his people.</p>

<p>"One day she said to him: 'My grandson,
you are old enough to prove yourself a man.
Before you can become a great warrior you
must show that you are able to endure many
hardships without complaint.</p>

<p>"'Set forth on a long journey alone and
without food. Travel through unknown forests,
enduring hunger and thirst. Sleep on
the cold ground, and pray for a vision that
shall be your guide through life.'</p>

<p>"Manabush took his bow and arrows and
went out into the forest. He fasted many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
days until he became weak and faint from
hunger.</p>

<p>"In his wanderings he drew near the shore
of a lake. Great beds of wild rice filled half its
waters, but Manabush did not know that the
seeds were good to eat.</p>

<p>"As he walked along within reach of the
growing plants, he heard a soft voice say,
'Sometimes they eat us.'</p>

<p>"'Who is speaking?' he asked. All the
bushes that grew so thickly in the water
seemed full of whispers. He looked about and
saw birds of many kinds feeding on the tall
grass-like plants.</p>

<p>"So he picked some of the grain and ate
it. 'Oh, but you are good! What do they
call you?' he asked.</p>

<p>"Again the rustling whispers in the tall
grass seemed to say, 'Wild rice. They call us
wild rice!'</p>

<p>"Manabush waded out into the water and
beat the grain from the heads. So his fast was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
broken by the new food given in answer to his
prayers in the forest.</p>

<p>"And since that time, my children, the wild
rice feeds thousands of our people every year.
It grows without planting in the lakes and
rivers of our forest land.</p>

<p>"Another story tells us that Manabush
returned one day from a long hunt without
game. The fire in front of his lodge was still
burning, and a duck was sitting on the kettle
eating boiled rice.</p>

<p>"Manabush tasted the new food and found
it good. He followed the bird to a lake not far
away where wild rice had grown and ripened.
Afterwards boiled rice became a common food
among his tribe."</p>

<h2>MOVING THE DOLLS' CAMP</h2>

<p>White Cloud ran out of her wigwam home.
Her work was done, and a happy time of play
was before her.</p>

<p>She hurried through the tall grass toward
a near-by lodge, calling: "Flying Squirrel,
come and play with me."</p>

<p>The skin curtain hanging over the lodge
door was raised and a little head appeared.
But there was no squirrel to be seen, only
an Indian girl with the blackest of hair and
eyes.</p>

<p>Her playmates had given her the name of
Flying Squirrel because she was always
climbing trees and jumping from one branch
to another.</p>

<p>"Bring your dolls," said White Cloud.
"We'll build lodges for them. Come as soon
as you can, for my baby is trying to get away."</p>

<p>"Your baby! What do you mean? Where
did you find a baby?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>White Cloud was rejoicing in a family of
young puppies&mdash;new playthings for her. She
had bound one of them to a board, and had tied
the board cradle to her back, as a squaw carries
a papoose.</p>

<p>"Be still! Be still, bad baby!" she cried to
her squirming pet. But the little dog would
not be still. He howled louder and louder,
and struggled so hard that he broke away
from his cords and bands.</p>

<p>"Bad baby! Bad baby!" said White Cloud.
"Next time I'll tie you tighter!"</p>

<p>Flying Squirrel brought out an armful of
dolls, and the children went to the bushes to
cut long straight sticks. They soon found
enough poles for their dolls' wigwams. Each
child set up her sticks in a circle, bringing
them together at the top.</p>

<p>"Now we'll hunt birch bark," said Flying
Squirrel. "My father has made me a new
knife."</p>

<p>Soon the small lodges were covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
long strips of bark and the floors sprinkled
with cedar twigs.</p>

<p>"I wish we had skin covers for our dolls'
wigwams," said White Cloud.</p>

<p>Flying Squirrel looked at the even strips
of bark that were well placed around her
frame of slender poles. "Lots of people
have bark covers," she replied. "My father
has seen whole villages of bark-covered
lodges."</p>

<p>"When the peace pipe was smoked over
west, my father was there," said White Cloud.
"Now we can get big skins in trade, and sometime
we'll have ponies. Have you ever seen
a pony, Flying Squirrel?"</p>

<p>"No; but my father saw white men when
he went north in the moon of snow to trade
furs. He says the tribes west will come and
fight us again for our rice beds. Let's play a
war is coming and move our camp. Where
are your dolls, White Cloud?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't bring them, for I had my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
puppy baby. You have dolls enough for both
of us."</p>

<p>Flying Squirrel gave her playmate two of
the queerest-looking dolls you ever saw. They
were rolls of deerskin with faces painted in
black on the ends.</p>

<p>The children tied the smaller dolls in board
cradles, hung them to the lodge poles, and
sang lullabies.</p>

<p>Good Bird had packed a basket of food for
her little daughter. Dried meat, berries,
parched rice, and corn made a fine feast. All
were invited, even the puppy, and the largest
dolls were honored guests.</p>

<p>"I wish I had my new beaded bag to show
you," said White Cloud. "I shall put my
doll's best clothes in it and hang it over
her bed. Are you learning to sew, Flying
Squirrel?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to sew. I would rather climb
trees. It's time to move now. Let's get
ready. We will go to the stream that flows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
into the lake." And Flying Squirrel began to
whistle for her dogs.</p>

<p>"My big dog is home with the rest of her
puppies. May I have one of yours?" asked
White Cloud. "Last moon my father visited
a friendly camp. There were thirty lodges
and more dogs than he could count. I wish he
had brought me another big one."</p>

<p>White Cloud did not say "thirty," for she
knew no word for so large a number. She
raised her ten fingers three times, just as she
had seen her father do.</p>

<p>Flying Squirrel called her dogs, and they
came running to her. She had begun to train
them to draw loads, and they stood quite still
while the girls harnessed them for moving.
The bark covers of the two lodges were taken
off and carefully rolled. Then the lodge
poles were corded in two long straight
bundles. Flying Squirrel crossed the small
ends and fastened them above the dog's back.
The large ends dragged on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0111-illus" id="i0111-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0111-illus.png" width="500" height="307" alt="Harnessed dogs" title="Harnessed dogs"/>
</div>

<p>Back of the dog the sticks were held in
place by two cross pieces of wood carefully
tied a little way apart. Between the cross
pieces was a strong netting that hung down
like a shallow bag. The dolls and rolls of bark
were laid in one of the nets. What should the
other dog carry?</p>

<p>"I know," exclaimed White Cloud. "My
puppy shall have a ride." He was caught and
firmly tied. The net was a comfortable bed,
and he made no objection.</p>

<p>Soon the camp was packed, and the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
started. The dogs trotted along quietly,
and everything went well for a time. As they
came near the little stream where they wished
to set their camp, a rabbit ran across the trail.
Away went the dogs.</p>

<p>The rabbit leaped over the narrow stream.
One of the dogs plunged after him, and out
went the dolls and bark into the water.</p>

<p>The other dog shook himself free from his
harness. The lodge poles he was dragging
turned upside down, holding the howling
puppy in the mud.</p>

<p>"Oh, my puppy will drown!" cried White
Cloud as she dashed down the muddy banks
in rescue.</p>

<p>"My dolls! My best dolls are spoiled!"
mourned Flying Squirrel.</p>

<p>Soon the dogs were called back, everything
found, the dolls bathed and laid out to dry.
Then the lodges were set up, and the children
rested in the sun.</p>

<p>As they looked about, White Cloud saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
feather lying on the grass. It was painted,
as if it had fallen from a warrior's bonnet.</p>

<p>"You had better take that feather to your
father now," said Flying Squirrel. "Perhaps
there is going to be a war, and a spy has passed
this way. I am afraid. I shall pack all my
things and go home with my dogs.</p>

<p>"Here, put this leaf around it and run to
your mother. She will know what to do."</p>

<p>Away ran White Cloud, holding a sprawling
puppy in her arms and trying to protect
the feather, which she had concealed in a
large leaf.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<h2>FINDING A WAR FEATHER</h2>

<p>"Look, Mother; look at the big feather
I have found. It is not like the ones in my
father's war bonnet."</p>

<p>Good Bird took the feather and examined
it carefully.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it, White Cloud?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Near the little stream that runs into the
lake. Flying Squirrel and I have moved our
dolls' lodges this morning."</p>

<p>"You must take the feather to your father
at once. It may be that some enemy is planning
war and getting ready to surprise our
camp.</p>

<p>"Then you must move your dolls and their
lodge near by where I can see you play. You
may be in danger.</p>

<p>"Your father is spearing fish in the lake.
Now run to him. Let no one see the feather,
and do not turn aside to talk to any one like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
the little hare that did not mind its mother."</p>

<p>"When will you tell me the story of the
hare?" asked White Cloud.</p>

<p>"Do not talk about stories now. Run along.
You must not wait a minute. I will watch you
all the way. Your father, I think, will come
back with you."</p>

<p>White Cloud soon found her father. He
left his fishing and returned with his little
daughter.</p>

<p>A council of the tribe was called, for the
strange feather had been dropped by no
friendly Indian.</p>

<p>Then the medicine drum was beaten to call
the people together. They were told of the
danger, and there was a great stir in the village.
Everything was made ready for sudden
moving in case of attack. All the trained dogs
were called and tied in the wigwams of their
owners.</p>

<p>A guard of young Indians was placed on
watch for the night. Fleet Deer came late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to his lodge, and after eating he joined the
warriors.</p>

<p>As nothing more could be done, Good Bird
comforted her frightened little daughter by
stories. Swift Elk pretended to be very
brave. He did not run out of the wigwam as
usual, but lay on the ground and listened to
his mother.</p>

<p>"Now, my daughter," she said, "I'll tell
you the story you asked for this morning."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LYNX AND THE HARE</h2>

<p>Once a little hare asked her mother if she
might play on the big rock near the lodge.</p>

<p>"Yes, little one, but you must not leave
the rock. And be sure that you do not speak
to any stranger who passes by," replied her
mother.</p>

<p>Now the rock was low near the lodge, but
very high on the other side, where it overlooked
a stream.</p>

<p>A hungry lynx saw the little hare jumping
on the high rock. "I must have that hare for
my dinner," he said. So he spoke in a kind
voice. "Wabose, Wabose. Come here, my
little white one."</p>

<p>The hare went to the edge of the rock and
looked down.</p>

<p>"Come here, pretty Wabose. I want to
talk with you," said the lynx in a coaxing
voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the hare. "I am afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
you. My mother told me not to talk to
strangers."</p>

<p>"You are very pretty, and you are a good,
obedient child. But I am not a stranger.
I am a relative of yours. Go down the rock
and come to the stream where I can see you
better. I want to send some word to your
lodge. Come down and see me, you pretty
little hare."</p>

<p>The hare was pleased to be praised and
called pretty. When she heard that the lynx
was a relative, she forgot to obey her mother.</p>

<p>She jumped down from the rock where she
stood and trotted to the stream. There the
lynx pounced upon her and tore her to pieces.</p>

<p>"Don't you know any war stories?" asked
Swift Elk.</p>

<p>"Yes; I heard one in the moon of snow that
you will like," answered his mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<h2>HOW THE ANIMALS SAVED THE TRIBE</h2>

<p>Once there was an Indian village in great
danger. The trail of the enemy had been
found on every side of the camp.</p>

<p>The women were making ready for flight.
They had harnessed their dogs to the dragging
poles. The rawhide netting between the
braces that held the poles in place was packed
with household goods.</p>

<p>An attack was expected in the early morning.
Guards were stationed to call the men
to battle, and to tell the women which way to
flee with their children.</p>

<p>The warriors all were ready. Their chief
went out alone under the stars, and prayed
that he might be able to save his people from
death.</p>

<p>Suddenly a deer with branching horns
stood before him. "I have come to tell you
that your prayers are heard," he said.</p>

<p>"We, the animals, invite you to our council.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
We shall give you the power to save your
tribe."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0120-illus" id="i0120-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0120-illus.png" width="500" height="308" alt="At the opening of a cave" title="At the opening of a cave"/>
</div>

<p>They traveled on together until they came
to a cave under a rocky bluff near the river.
Here the warrior chief was welcomed and
given the seat of honor.</p>

<p>Every animal of field and forest, and every
bird of the air, had gathered in the immense
cavern. There was silence for a moment.
Then a great eagle flapped his wings. He
stood on a jutting rock in sight of all.</p>

<p>"Your acts of kindness, oh, warrior, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
known to us," said the eagle. "You have
hunted only for food, as the animals hunt.
Your arrows have not been shot to take life
without a reason. No bird nor beast has been
left by you to suffer and die.</p>

<p>"Therefore, I, the eagle, king of birds, give
you of my courage. You shall fear no warlike
band, however many. Alone you shall conquer
the enemy."</p>

<p>"And I," said the bear, "give you of my gift
of healing. You shall be able to cure yourself,
and also your fellow warriors, of any wounds
you may receive in battle."</p>

<p>"My fleetness is yours," said the deer.
"You shall outstrip all others and run like the
wind."</p>

<p>The wolf stretched himself and walked
noiselessly into the circle. "When you creep
into the enemy's camp," he said, "no eye shall
be able to see you. Thus may you rout your
enemies, and no one shall know who is striking
the blows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>"I am small," said the field mouse; "I leave
no tracks on the grass, and send no sound into
the air. I give you my power, that none may
follow your trail nor hear your footfall."</p>

<p>"No one can give a better gift than I," said
the owl. "You shall see in the dark as I do.
The night shall be to you like the day."</p>

<p>"You have fed me," said the dog. "You
have taken me into your lodge and let me lie
by the warm fire. I give you in return my
power of smell that you may follow the trail
of your enemy."</p>

<p>Suddenly there was no cave in sight, no
animals in council. Where he had been praying
under the open sky, the warrior chief stood
alone. Was it all a dream?</p>

<p>From the grass came a faint strange smell.
He followed it fast as the fleetest deer. In
what seemed but a moment he was in sight
of the sleeping foe.</p>

<p>He entered their camp as silently as the
field mouse. Like the eagle he had no fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
He struck out with his weapons. In great
surprise the painted Indians awoke and
jumped to their feet.</p>

<p>Wounded men fell under blows that could
not be seen nor heard. Their chief lay still
upon the ground.</p>

<p>"There is magic here," they cried. "We
cannot fight against magic." And they
aroused their band and fled, leaving everything
behind them.</p>

<p>Then the victor sped with the fleetness of
the deer to his own tribe. The men, waiting
for the battle signal, followed him to the
deserted camp. They returned laden with
weapons, the finest of bows and arrows, spears,
war bonnets, stores of food, and other spoils
of war.</p>

<p>Joy spread among the people. In the
village of wigwams feasting took the place
of fear.</p>

<p>"I wish I had been that warrior," said
Swift Elk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>"You may have a chance to be just as brave
to-morrow," answered his mother. "I depend
on you to take your father's place here if he
goes into battle."</p>

<p>The children could keep awake no longer,
but Good Bird did not close her eyes. The
dawn came on, the sun rose, and there was no
attack.</p>

<p>For many days and nights the young
braves took their turn in watching. There
were no further signs of an enemy, and no one
ever found out how the strange feather came
to be dropped near the camp.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<h2>WINTER EVENINGS</h2>

<p>The wind roared in the trees, and the snow
was falling. But Fleet Deer's lodge was warm
and comfortable. Good Bird, his wife, knew
how to make a lodge, and how to keep it from
being smoky.</p>

<p>She had sewed heavy skins together for
the outside cover of the wigwam. Inside, the
lower walls were of tanned doeskin, nearly
white. The cold air passing between the
lining and the cover ventilated the room and
carried the smoke out of the smoke hole.</p>

<p>In the middle of the circular floor was a
stone-lined fire pit, now filled with glowing
coals that gave light to the room.</p>

<p>Warm skins with the fur uppermost covered
the three long platforms that were used
for seats in the daytime and for beds at night.</p>

<p>Good Bird took great pride in her home.
She kept the floor swept with a cedar broom
and everything in its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0126-illus" id="i0126-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0126-illus.png" width="500" height="299" alt="Drawing and preparing the food" title="Drawing and preparing the food"/>
</div>

<p>When not busy in preparing food, she
made clothing and moccasins. She stained
porcupine quills for trimmings, and made
necklaces of shells. The teeth of wild animals
were used for ornaments.</p>

<p>On this cold winter evening Good Bird
was dressed in a handsome garment
trimmed with fringe and colored quills.
Her moccasins and leggings were also ornamented.</p>

<p>She had braided her hair neatly, and drawn
a line of fresh red paint along the parting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Her forehead and cheeks were also touched
with red.</p>

<p>"Are you going to a dance, Mother?" asked
White Cloud.</p>

<p>Good Bird said nothing, but smiled as
she thought of the guest who was expected
and the pleasant surprise in store for her
children.</p>

<p>The evening meal was over. Nokomis had
opened her stores of maple sugar and corn in
honor of Swift Elk, who had won the game
of tops that day.</p>

<p>Whipping his winter top over level snow
and high drifts alike, he had outdistanced his
companions by fifty paces.</p>

<p>White Cloud sat by the fire drying her
moccasins. She had been out sliding with her
playmates until the sun left the sky. You
would have thought their sleds very funny,
for they were made of the curved rib bones of
a large deer.</p>

<p>Swift Elk was studying the strange signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and markings on the lining of the wigwam.
He was never tired of hearing the pictures
explained, for they showed in order the chief
events in his father's life.</p>

<p>Here was the grizzly bear that Fleet Deer
had killed single-handed. For this deed of
bravery he was entitled to wear an eagle's
feather.</p>

<p>Here was the deer that was killed in time
of famine, after a long and dangerous hunt.</p>

<p>Other pictures showed Indians in the war
dance, on the war trail, surprising the foe, returning
with the honors of battle, holding a
council, and smoking the peace pipe.</p>

<p>Fleet Deer was master of the Indian art of
picture writing, and he had, that very day,
added new paintings to the record. His children
had never heard of any other way to read
or write, and they had never seen a book.</p>

<p>The flap of skin covering the lodge entrance
was raised and a man entered.</p>

<p>"The story-teller! The story-teller!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
shouted the children with delight. He was
given the seat of honor and the best food that
Good Bird could provide.</p>

<p>When the guest was warm and his meal
over, favorite stories were asked for.</p>

<p>"We ought to hear again of the great gift
of corn to our people," said Good Bird.</p>

<p>"New stories, I want new stories. Will
you tell us some new stories?" asked White
Cloud.</p>

<p>"War stories, I want, and stories of boys,"
said Swift Elk.</p>

<p>Then Fleet Deer, the father, spoke: "I
wish my son to know the tale of the White
Canoe and how a great warrior honored his
parents."</p>

<p>Nokomis had no request. She was a fine
story-teller herself and interested in hearing
everything that might be related.</p>

<p>Then, to the joy of his hearers, the story-teller
began.</p>

<p>First he delighted the children by telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of the ground hog that saved his own life by
teaching a new dance.</p>

<p>The next tale was about the first animals
and how they came to live in the forests and
on the plains.</p>

<p>After the story-teller had explained how
sickness came into the world, Fleet Deer
wanted to be a medicine man and find all the
plants that cure disease.</p>

<p>And so they all listened to one tale after
another until the midnight stars shone overhead
and the embers grew white where the
burning logs had sparkled.</p>

<p>Now you may read for yourselves the
stories that were told in an Indian lodge on a
winter evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE GROUND-HOG DANCE</h2>

<p>Seven wolves once caught a ground hog.
"Now we'll kill you and have something good
to eat," they said.</p>

<p>But the ground hog replied: "When we
find good food we must rejoice over it, as people
do in the green-corn dance. I know you
mean to kill me, and I can't help myself, but
if you want to dance I'll sing for you.</p>

<p>"I will teach you a new dance. I'll lean
up against seven trees in turn, and you will
dance away, then come back toward me. At
the last turn you may kill me."</p>

<p>The wolves were very hungry, but they
wanted to learn the new dance. So they told
the ground hog to go ahead. The ground hog
leaned up against the first tree and began the
song.</p>

<p>All the wolves danced away from the trees.
When the signal was given they danced back
in line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0132-illus" id="i0132-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0132-illus.png" width="500" height="336" alt="Dancing wolves" title="Dancing wolves"/>
</div>

<p>"That's fine!" said the ground hog, as he
went to the second tree and began the second
song. The wolves danced away, then turned
at the signal and danced back again.</p>

<p>"That's very fine," said the ground hog;
and he went to another tree and started the
third song.</p>

<p>The wolves danced their best, and were
praised by the ground hog. At each song he
took another tree, and each tree was a little
nearer to his hole under a stump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>At the seventh song he said, "Now this is
the last dance. When I give the signal you
will all turn and come after me. The one who
catches me may have me."</p>

<p>So the ground hog began the last song, and
kept it up until the wolves were many steps
away. Just as the signal was given he made a
jump for his hole.</p>

<p>The wolves turned and were after him.
But the ground hog reached his hole and dived
in. He was scarcely inside when the foremost
wolf caught him by the tail and pulled so hard
that it broke off.</p>

<p>And the ground hog's tail has been short
ever since.</p>

<h2>THE LUCKY HUNTER</h2>

<p>Soon after the world was made, a hunter
lived with his wife and only son near a high
mountain. No matter when the man went
into the woods he was sure to come back with
plenty of meat. And so he went by the name
of the Lucky Hunter.</p>

<p>The little boy used to play every day by a
river not far from the house. One morning
the old people thought they heard laughing
and talking in the bushes as if two children
were playing together.</p>

<p>When the boy came home at night he was
asked who had been with him all day.</p>

<p>"A wild boy comes out of the water,"
answered the son. "He says he is my elder
brother."</p>

<p>The father and mother wished very much
to see their son's companion, but the wild boy
always ran into the river when he heard them
coming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>"This must not go on," said the father.</p>

<p>That night the Lucky Hunter said to his
son: "To-morrow when the wild boy comes to
play, ask him to wrestle with you. When you
have your arms around him, you must hold
him and call us."</p>

<p>In this way the wild boy was caught and
kept in the house until he was tamed. He was
full of mischief, and he led the smaller boy
into all kinds of trouble.</p>

<p>One day the wild boy said to his brother:
"I wonder where our father gets all his game.
Let's follow him and find out."</p>

<p>A few days afterward the Lucky Hunter
took a bow and some feathers in his hand and
went toward a swamp. After waiting a short
time, the boys followed.</p>

<p>The old man cut reeds, fitted the feathers
to them, and made arrows.</p>

<p>"What are those things for, I wonder?"
said the wild boy.</p>

<p>When the Lucky Hunter had finished his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
arrows, he went on over the low hills and up
the mountain.</p>

<p>Keeping out of sight, the boys watched
him. When he was halfway to the top he
stopped and lifted a large rock in the side of
the mountain.</p>

<p>At once a deer ran out. The Lucky Hunter
killed it with his first arrow. Then he carefully
replaced the heavy stone and pulled a
strong vine over it to conceal the cracks.</p>

<p>"Oho," said the boys. "He keeps the deer
shut up inside of the mountain. When he
wants meat he lets one out and kills it with the
arrows he made in the swamp."</p>

<p>They hurried to reach home before their
father, who had the heavy deer to carry.</p>

<p>A few days later the boys went to the
swamp, made arrows, and started up the
mountain. When they came to the hole,
they lifted the rock and a deer came running
out.</p>

<p>Before they could shoot him another came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
and another. The boys could not stop them,
and they could not shoot them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/0137-illus.png" width="500" height="336" alt="Running animals" title="Running animals"/>
</div>

<p>Other animals made a rush for the entrance.
There were elk, antelope, raccoons,
wolves, foxes, panthers, and many others.
They scattered in all directions and disappeared
in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Then a great flock of birds came flying out
of the hole. There were turkeys, geese, ducks,
quail, eagles, robins, hawks, and owls.</p>

<p>They darkened the air like a cloud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
made such a noise with their wings that the
Lucky Hunter heard them.</p>

<p>"My bad boys have got into trouble," he
cried. "I must go and see what they are
doing."</p>

<p>So he went up the mountain and found the
two boys standing by the opening. Not an
animal nor a bird was to be seen.</p>

<p>Their father was very angry. Without a
word he went into the cave and kicked off the
covers of four jars. Out swarmed wasps, hornets,
gnats, flies, mosquitoes, and all manner
of stinging and biting insects and bugs.</p>

<p>The boys screamed with pain. They rolled
over and over on the ground, trying to brush
off their tormentors.</p>

<p>Their father looked on until he thought
they had been punished enough. Then he
spoke.</p>

<p>"See what you have done, you rascals.
Always before you have had enough to eat
without working for it. Whenever you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
hungry, all I had to do was to come up here
and take home anything your mother wanted
to cook.</p>

<p>"After this when you want a deer to eat,
you will have to hunt all over the woods for it,
and then may not find one.</p>

<p>"Now you may go and take care of yourselves."</p>

<h2>HOW SICKNESS CAME</h2>

<p>In the old days when the beasts, birds,
fishes, insects, and plants could talk, they
lived in peace and friendship with the children
of men.</p>

<p>But, as time went on, the people increased
in number, and they crowded the animals out
of their homes.</p>

<p>This was bad enough, but, to make it
worse, man invented bows and arrows, spears,
knives, and hooks, and began to kill the
animals.</p>

<p>They were killed for clothing, and they
were killed for food, and still they were patient.
But when man began to kill them for
sport, they determined to unite for common
safety.</p>

<p>The bears first met in council with their
chief. After each in turn had complained of
the cruel treatment of man, they all declared
war against him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Some of the bears proposed to make weapons
and use them. But the chief said: "It is
better to trust to the teeth and claws which
Nature has given us."</p>

<p>As no one could think of other plans, their
chief dismissed the council. The bears returned
to the woods, and have done little harm
to man ever since.</p>

<p>The deer next held a council. They decided
that any one who killed a deer without
asking his pardon should be lame with many
pains.</p>

<p>The reptiles and the fish talked the matter
over. They agreed to punish man by making
him dream of snakes and of eating raw fish.</p>

<p>In the last council the birds, rabbits, squirrels,
ducks, and the smaller animals came
together. All complained of stolen nests,
stones, and arrows.</p>

<p>The ground squirrel alone said a good word
for man. This made the others so angry that
they fell upon the little animal and tore him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
with their claws. You can see the stripes on
his back even to this day.</p>

<p>Then all the squirrels that had lost legs or
tail by arrows, all rabbits running on three
legs, all birds that had seen their little ones
die, all wild ducks lamed, and all animals that
had ever been wounded for sport rose up and
called for revenge.</p>

<p>"Let the pains and the trouble that man
has sent to us and our children be sent to him
and his children," they demanded.</p>

<p>"But how can we do this?" asked the
others. "We cannot turn man's weapons
against him."</p>

<p>"Let us send new diseases," proposed a
limping fox.</p>

<p>All rose up with pleasure at this proposal.
And they commenced to invent diseases so
fast that they had soon named every kind of
sickness that you ever heard of. Had they
thought of many more, no human beings
would now be alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>The grubworm, who had been stepped on
by man, was so delighted that he fell over
backwards and has had to wriggle on his back
ever since.</p>

<p>But the plants continued friendly to man.
When they heard what the animals had done,
they promised to help him and his children
forever.</p>

<p>Every tree and plant, even the grass and
the moss, agreed to furnish a cure for one of
the diseases sent by the animals.</p>

<p>Each said in turn: "I shall help man when
he calls on me in his need."</p>

<p>Thus came medicine. And if we only knew
where to look, we might find among the plants
a cure for every kind of sickness.</p>

<h2>HOW SPRING CONQUERED WINTER</h2>

<p>Far to the North lives the terrible giant,
Winter. When he leaves his home, all people
dread his coming. He whistles, and the
storms roar about him. Where he steps,
the ground turns to rock and plants bow their
heads to the earth.</p>

<p>All the animals flee before him and hide in
caves and hollow trees. The children leave
their happy play and sit shivering by the wigwam
fire.</p>

<p>One day old Winter looked about him. He
saw no life in field or forest. The wind raged,
and the drifts almost hid the lodges of the
Indians.</p>

<p>"The world is conquered; I am the only
king," said giant Winter. He sat alone in his
lodge. The fire was white with ashes, and the
tempest howled.</p>

<p>A step was heard, and a young warrior
entered the lodge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>He was tall and straight and youthful.</p>

<p>Old Winter welcomed the stranger. "Sit
here on the mat beside me," he said. "Let us
pass the night together. You shall tell me of
your strange adventures, and of the lands in
which you have traveled."</p>

<p>The old man drew his long peace pipe from
its pouch. It was made of red sandstone, and
its stem was a smooth reed. He lighted the
pipe from the dying embers and passed it to
his guest.</p>

<p>Long they talked and smoked together,
each boasting of his power.</p>

<p>"When I blow my breath about me," said
old Winter, "rivers stop their flowing, and
water turns to stone."</p>

<p>The young man smiled. "When I blow
my breath about me," he replied, "I free your
prisoned waters, and they rush onward to
the seas."</p>

<p>"My power is greater than yours," boasted
Winter. "I have only to shake my long hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and the leaves die on the branches. Plants
bow their heads before me and go back into
the earth."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0146-illus" id="i0146-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0146-illus.png" width="500" height="306" alt="Old Winter and Spring" title="Old Winter and Spring"/>
</div>

<p>And now the stranger laughed as he
boasted of greater power. "When I shake
my curling locks, I call the leaves back on
the branches. The plants come out of the
brown earth and bring forth their flowers
and fruit."</p>

<p>Old Winter frowned. "I speak, and the
birds fly away. I command, and the wild
beasts obey me. They hide in caves. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
burrow in the earth. They do not venture to
look upon my face!"</p>

<p>"I call back the birds you have sent away,"
replied the stranger. "They hear my voice
and return to their nesting places. I speak,
and the beasts leave their shelters and fill the
forests and the plains with life."</p>

<p>"I am the king," shouted Winter, "for even
man obeys me. When I send the tempest, the
mightiest warriors turn and flee. They close
the doors of their lodges, and I imprison them
with drifts of snow."</p>

<p>"I also have power over man," replied the
stranger. "My name is Spring. I melt your
snow and open the wigwam doors. All men
rejoice, and they come forth to hunt and feast
and dance."</p>

<p>The night waned, and the sun came from
his lodge like a painted warrior. The air grew
warm and pleasant, and the bluebird and the
robin sang on the lodge poles.</p>

<p>But the giant! What was taking place?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
He was growing smaller. Now he was no
larger than a common man. His war bonnet
was no longer white, but old and gray, and its
feathers were falling one by one.</p>

<p>Still the giant dwindled. Smaller and
smaller he grew. Tears flowed from his eyes.
He vanished from sight, and fled away with a
noise like the rush of waters. Far to the north
he flew where the snow never melts.</p>

<p>Thus did Spring, the beautiful youth, conquer
the great and mighty Winter.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus it was that in the Northland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the Spring with all its splendor,<br /></span>

<h2>THE GIFT OF CORN</h2>

<p>A tribe of Indians once lived on the beautiful
islands of a large lake. They were driven
from their homes by hostile tribes. Men,
women, and children left everything they
owned and paddled their canoes westward to
the mainland.</p>

<p>But Manabush, the bravest of the warriors,
remained behind. It was his purpose to keep
close watch of the enemy, and to send warning
in time to prevent surprise.</p>

<p>Every day he paddled his birch canoe close
to the shore, hiding in nooks and bays. He
had with him two boys, and with their aid the
canoe was hauled every night into the thick
woods.</p>

<p>As they walked, they carefully covered
their footprints with sand.</p>

<p>Each day Manabush thought of his suffering
people, whose supplies of food had been
stolen by the enemy. The brave warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
prayed to the spirits of earth and air, asking
that food be given to his tribe.</p>

<p>One morning Manabush rose early, leaving
the two boys asleep. He went out from
the tent and walked in the forest, where he
could not be seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly he came out upon an open plain.
Approaching him was a handsome youth
dressed in garments of green and yellow. In
his hair he wore a red plume.</p>

<p>Truly this stranger must come from skyland,
he thought. What answer does he
bring?</p>

<p>"I am Mondamin," said the strange man.
"Your prayers are heard, for you pray, not
for yourself, but for your people. I have come
to show you how by labor and struggle you
can gain what you have prayed for. You must
wrestle with me."</p>

<p>Long they strove together. The man of
the red feather was strong and active, but at
last he was thrown to the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0151-illus" id="i0151-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0151-illus.png" width="500" height="337" alt="Mondamin, the spirit of the corn" title="Mondamin, the spirit of the corn"/>
</div>

<p>"I have thrown you! I have thrown you!"
shouted Manabush.</p>

<p>"You have gained a great gift for your
people," said Mondamin, "for I am the spirit
of the corn."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a wonderful change took
place. Gone was the man who had wrestled
with such strength. His garments had turned
into green and yellow corn husks, and his
body to a ripe red ear of corn. But the red
plume was still waving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>Again the voice of Mondamin was heard
from the ground. "Take from me my covers.
Scatter my kernels over the plain. Break my
spine and throw it all about you.</p>

<p>"Make the earth soft and light above me.
Let no bird disturb me, and let no weed share
my resting place. Watch me till I stand once
more tall and beautiful. Then you shall have
food for your people."</p>

<p>Manabush obeyed all that the voice had
commanded. On the way back to his canoe he
killed a deer, but he said no word to his
companions of his strange adventure with the
man of the red feather.</p>

<p>When the new moon hung like a bow in the
west, he visited the field alone. What were
the wide grass-like blades making green the
plain? What were the vines that sent their
runners all about?</p>

<p>Carefully he tilled the field. The stems
grew strong, and the broad leaves gleamed in
the sunshine. Still he kept the secret, spending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
many hours in watching for his enemies.</p>

<p>When summer drew near its close, Manabush
paddled his canoe to the shore nearest
the wrestling ground. He found the corn clad
in green and yellow, with red plumes waving.
And great yellow pumpkins were ripening on
the green vines.</p>

<p>As he picked the ripe red ears he heard a
voice from the field, saying: "Victory has
crowned your struggles, O Manabush. The
gift of corn is to your people, and will always
be their food."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE MAGIC CANOE</h2>

<p>One night, as Manabush was lying on
the ground in the thick woods, he heard
strange voices. "This is no common enemy,"
he said to himself. But he lay motionless
and listened.</p>

<p>The evil spirits were plotting to take his
life. By his magic power he was able to defend
himself from their attacks, and they
slipped away unseen.</p>

<p>In the morning he went to the open shore.
There he saw a canoe drawn up on the beach.
Coming near, he found a man in the bow and
another in the stern. They had been changed
into stone images as a punishment for their
wicked deeds.</p>

<p>The canoe was the largest and finest that
Manabush had ever seen. It was full of bags
of the most beautiful clothing and stores of
the rarest food.</p>

<p>Manabush carried all the treasures into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the wood and concealed them in a cave. Then
he took the magic canoe and hid it among the
rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a name="i0155-illus" id="i0155-illus"></a>
<img src="images/0155-illus.png" width="500" height="325" alt="A magic canoe" title="A magic canoe"/>
</div>

<p>A voice was heard from one of the stone
images: "In this way will the canoes of your
people be loaded when they pass again along
this coast."</p>

<p>Manabush returned to his two young
companions, bidding them arise and cook.
He showed them the abundance of meat
and fish, the bags of maple sugar and dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
berries, and other foods liked by the Indians.</p>

<p>Then he thought of his aged father and
mother, who had fled far from their homes.
Danger seemed past, and he wished them to
return and share his gifts.</p>

<p>Westward he sailed in the magic canoe.
He needed no paddles, for his wishes guided
him, and the boat flew through the water with
amazing speed.</p>

<p>Before daylight he was at the lodge of his
parents. He found them asleep, and he carried
them to his canoe so gently that they did
not awaken.</p>

<p>When they awoke in the morning, they
could hardly believe their eyes. They had left
behind hunger and a barren lodge. They
found themselves in their own country, with
abundance all about them.</p>

<p>Food was placed before them. Then the
bags were opened. There were beaded dresses
for the mother and war bonnets for the father.
There were moccasins and warm blankets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
There were skins as soft as the most skilled
work could produce.</p>

<p>Manabush built his parents a lodge near
the cornfield and filled it with every comfort.
Then he brought ears of corn and pumpkins
and laid before them. He told them of his
wrestling with Mondamin, and he showed
them the field where the corn stood in its
garments of green and yellow, waving its red
plumes.</p>

<p>The secret of the magic canoe, the stone
images, and the wonderful gifts was shared
by Manabush with his father and mother.</p>

<p>When spring returned a large cornfield
grew and prospered. The exiled tribe came
back, and from that time they were noted for
their fine crops of maize.</p>

<h2>THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS</h2>

<p>All who leave the earth must follow the
death trail. Each walks alone&mdash;warrior,
squaw, or child. All but papoose. The good
spirits carry papoose.</p>

<p>The trail goes on and on to the place where
the sun slips over the edge of the earth plane.
There it comes to a deep, rapid stream, and the
only bridge is a slippery pine log.</p>

<p>On the other side of the river are six
strange beings with rocks in their hands.
These rocks are magic stones which can injure
only those who have done evil, but can never
touch nor harm the good.</p>

<p>When the one who follows the death trail
reaches the middle of the log, he sees the stones
come flying toward him.</p>

<p>If his life has been evil, he tries to dodge;
therefore, he slips off the log and falls into the
black, swirling water.</p>

<p>Sometimes he crawls out of the stream and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
climbs to the top of the rocks. But he can
never reach the country of the good spirits.</p>

<p>There is only one trail to the Happy Hunting
Grounds, and that is over the narrow, slippery
log. But if the one who is crossing has
brought good to his kinsmen and his tribe,
he does not fear.</p>

<p>He knows that no harm can come from the
stones that fly around him, and so he keeps
his footing and walks safely over.</p>

<p>The trail winds on over high rocks to the
beautiful land. No storms and no winter enter
the Happy Hunting Grounds. The sky is
always blue, and the grass never grows dry
with heat nor brown with frost.</p>

<p>The trees are full of birds, the bushes of
fruit, and the forests are alive with game.
Feasting and dancing fill the day, and the war
cry is heard no more.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THE BOOK</h2>

<blockquote><p>The facts and stories which have made this little book possible
are found in the works of Schoolcraft and in the Government
reports of Ethnology. Especial credit is due to Albert E. Jenks,
author of "The Wild-Rice Indians of the Upper Lakes," and to
James Mooney, who reported for the Government the tribal myths
told by famous Cherokee story-tellers.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the Indians of early times had regular
trade routes across the continent, north and south, and east and
west. It was the custom of their story-tellers to exchange stories,
and it is therefore possible that some of the myths told in the
south found their way in northern wigwams. The story of the
birds welcoming a papoose, for example, is obtained in part from
the Cherokee collection, and in part from Schoolcraft, who lived
among the Ojibways, or Chippewas as they are often called. That
certain tales are similar to fables of &AElig;sop is explained by the
theory that a primitive people, observing nature, would originate
similar myths.</p>

<p>The forests where rice grew wild in the shallow water of lakes
and streams, were coveted lands and the cause of many Indian
wars. Here game was abundant, and maple sugar, berries, and
nuts could be obtained in season.</p>

<p>After years of conflict for the rice lands, peace was made between
the Ojibways of the Great Lakes and the Sioux, or Dakotahs,
farther west. Trade with the whites had begun, but
there were many villages which the white men had never entered,
and where the primitive customs were still unchanged.</p>

<p>As Hiawatha was not the only Indian who married a Dakotah,
it follows that there were homes where the family life was influenced
by the customs of both tribes.</p>

<p>The author has endeavored to describe child life in the Wild-Rice
region west of the Great Lakes at this period, and to retell
some of the most interesting stories enjoyed by Indian children.</p>

<p>The aim of the book is to gratify the American child's natural
interest in primitive life by stories of our own land and to increase
his respect for all that is original and worthy in the lives
of the First Americans.</p></blockquote>
